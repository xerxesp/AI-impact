EXT. SCENE1 - NIGHT - AMUSEMENT PARK ENTRANCE
K stands at the entrance of the amusement park. The night sky hangs low, but the lights shine brightly, creating a lively scene. Cheerful music plays from inside the park, with sounds of laughter, shouting, and screaming filling the air.

K walks into the amusement park as a repeated announcement rings in the air:
“Welcome to Wasteland Amusement Park, your paradise of joy!”

EXT. SCENE2 - NIGHT - DUCK TARGET RANGE
The park is filled with joy, and many robots are sitting on chairs next to vendor stalls, chatting, while others are playing and goofing off on containers.

K walks along the entrance and arrives at the first attraction: the Duck Target Range. The robot in charge of the range is shouting out to attract players.

@Target Range Manager
An exciting and thrilling target practice!

Upon seeing K approach, the manager eagerly explains the rules.

@Target Range Manager
Welcome to the world’s most popular Duck Target Range, where every sharpshooter's dream comes true!

The manager hands K a small handgun and an accessory, explaining the game’s rules.

@Target Range Manager
The rules are very simple. Each target has nine duck patterns. When the game starts, a flashing red dot will appear on the pattern. Your task is very simple: use the handgun to shoot at the flashing red dot!

@K
That’s it?
(picks up the accessory and inspects it)
What’s this？

@Target Range Manager
Great question! If you happen to miss a duck due to kindness, you’ll face a tiny little punishment. I promise, just a little bit. This healing bullet's role is, of course, to save your life!

K picks up the handgun and accessory and starts playing the target shooting game. After finishing the game, K receives amusement park coins based on performance.

@Target Range Manager
Congratulations! Challenge successful! Here’s your well-earned reward!

@K
What can I use these coins for?

@Target Range Manager
To try the next attraction. Hope you have a fun time at Wasteland Amusement Park!

K walks toward the next attraction.

EXT. SCENE3 - NIGHT - SPINNING TEACUPS
Cheerful music plays again, and under the moonlight, many robots are getting off the spinning teacups.

@Teacup Manager
Spin wildly! Spin crazily! Who wants to experience the craziest spinning teacups? Is it you? The next challenger!

K walks toward the manager, pays the fee, and the manager hands over a shotgun and an accessory.

@Teacup Manager
Oh ho ho! I bet you’ve never played a spinning teacup this thrilling! Let speed compare with passion, joy, endless joy!

@K
What does this accessory do?

@Teacup Manager
Dear, when you sit in the teacup, the whole world will go crazy for you! You think you can catch up, but you can't! The water bullets will help you slow down your targets. Good luck, crazy challenger!

K gets into a teacup. As the ride starts, it spins out of control. K uses the water bullets to slow down the constantly appearing NPCs and shoots them with the shotgun for points.

@Teacup Manager
Congratulations, crazy challenger! You’ve conquered madness, you’ve become a true crazy one! Here’s your reward, please don’t hold back, Wasteland Amusement Park will always welcome you!

K takes the coins and heads for the next attraction.

EXT. SCENE4 - NIGHT - ROLLER COASTER
Before even seeing the roller coaster, K can already hear the screams echoing in the air. When the massive roller coaster finally appears, K notices that there are many floating balloons in the sky, ranging in size.

K walks toward the roller coaster manager.

@Roller Coaster Manager
A roller coaster without thrills is no soul! Come, all of you who crave speed and passion!

K pays the coins and receives a submachine gun and a new accessory.

@Roller Coaster Manager
I’m sure you already know the rules, but I don’t mind repeating them.
(points to the balloons)
These floating balloons are your targets, shoot them for points! Isn’t it simple?

@K
(inspects the new accessory)
What’s the extra effect of this?

@Roller Coaster Manager
Of course, we want you to have fun and be satisfied! Wasteland Amusement Park, fulfilling all your dreams! Use sticky bombs to attach to multiple targets, and they will explode! How about that? Don’t you want to experience it now?

K gets on the roller coaster, shooting at the floating targets in the air and using sticky bombs to gather the balloons and trigger explosions as they pop in the air. After the ride stops, K gets off the ride, and the manager claps in applause.

@Roller Coaster Manager
Wonderful! Spectacular! Shocking! The whole night sky is bursting for you! You’ll become an amazing shooter! Grab your coins and head to the next destination to show off your skills!

K takes the coins and heads for the next attraction.

EXT. SCENE5 - NIGHT - GHOST TOWN
The ghost town is made of metal scraps and steel. Unlike the previous cheerful atmosphere, the ghost town is filled with a terrifying aura, with the constant sounds of metal being struck echoing in the distance.

@Ghost Town Manager
The brave adventurer has arrived! Ghost Town, Wasteland Amusement Park’s most famous attraction, awaits your exploration!

@K
This place has its own unique charm.

@Ghost Town Manager
Good eye. Here, take this.

The manager hands K a rifle and some accessories.

@Ghost Town Manager
Your only task is to catch the frightened little ghosts that are running around in the ghost town. To help with your hunt, gravity bullets, as the name suggests, change the gravity of objects. Use them well, don’t hesitate. Because the little ghosts are trickier than you think!

K equips the rifle and gravity bullets, searches for the little ghosts in the ghost town, uses gravity bullets to move through vertical spaces, and shoots the ghosts for points. When K reaches the exit, the ghosts vanish.

@Ghost Town Manager
A worthy hunter! Incredible hunting skills! Promise me you’ll use your talents well and become the greatest hunter! Here’s your prize, please continue to experience the next attraction, the paradise for hunters, Wasteland Amusement Park!

K collects the coins and leaves the ghost town.

EXT. SCENE6 - NIGHT - MINING CART
Unlike the smaller attractions, the mining cart is a huge outdoor ride that spans multiple hills. K can see several Ferris wheels standing tall on the slopes, with hot air balloons floating above.

@Mining Cart Manager
Welcome to the mountain-climbing mining cart, loved by both adults and kids! Here, you’ll experience an unprecedented chase! Conquer the mining cart, conquer Wasteland Amusement Park!

The manager hands K a long gun and a new accessory.

@Mining Cart Manager
Of course, as Wasteland Amusement Park’s signature ride, the difficulty rises sharply. Use shield bullets to block damage, and snipe your enemies. Attack when you can, defend when you must!

K equips the weapon, gets on the mining cart, shoots at the Ferris wheels and floating hot air balloons, and uses shield bullets to block damage. After completing the ride, K gets off, and the manager claps in appreciation.

@Mining Cart Manager
"Congratulations! You’ve completed the ultimate trial of Wasteland Amusement Park! Wasteland Amusement Park will always welcome you, hope you had fun and enjoyed yourself!"
