TITLE: 第十七章English Version

EXT. SCENE1 - DUSK - Autonomous Zone - Entrance
K and Xak disembark from the ship, blending into a crowd of people arriving at the Autonomous Zone. Feltu stands at the entrance, guiding everyone.

@Feltu
Come, come, my friends! You've had a long and tiring journey!
(makes a "quiet" gesture)
Thank you all so much for coming to the Autonomous Zone. I know many of you are curious about this place—don’t worry, I, Feltu, will answer all your questions.
(pauses)
The Autonomous Zone is a land that advocates for the coexistence of lifeforms and machines. Here, all residents must maintain peace and accept the ideals and vision of the zone（accept the ideals of the zone, as well as fulfil the vision of it. ）.
(pauses)
We will cast aside prejudice(move beyond prejudice), let go of the past, and embrace the people, things, and events around us anew. The Autonomous Zone will be a fresh start—no more bullying or exclusion, no more oppression or authoritarianism, no more division and trauma. We champion true democracy（we advocate true democracy）, transparency, and a rotational leadership system where everyone has a chance to contribute. I ask all of you to abandon outdated ideas(abandon your past) and embrace your future selves.

A young human male in the crowd raises his hand. Feltu gestures for him to speak.

@Hong Feiyu
As humans, how are we supposed to live in the Autonomous Zone?

@Feltu
Excellent question. Unlike the outside world, the Autonomous Zone does not use currency. Our survival model is self-sufficiency—(that is to say,)everyone must work, and the fruits of labor are distributed as needed.

@Qiu Sheng
Will we have food?

@Feltu
The zone provides all necessary resources for survival: food, shelter, medical equipment—but everything must be earned through labor.

@Hong Feiyu
I don’t get it. Life’s just food, clothes, and shelter—then what? What’s the point of the Autonomous Zone? Is it just aimless(Are people here just flâneurs without aims)?

@Feltu
Even aimlessness can be meaningful. I hope you’ll each find what the Autonomous Zone means to you, and vice versa. Now, it’s time for everyone to settle in, start working, and connect with those around you. I truly hope you enjoy your life here.

The crowd disperses. K notices many humans approaching robots and exchanging friendly greetings. He quietly asks Xak:

@K
Xak, is this really what you want?

Xak nods.

@K
If you’re sure… then fine, I’ll stay with you.

At this moment, Feltu approaches and says:

@Feltu
You two—if you’re available, we need more hands in the fields. Would you be willing to help?

Xak nods. Seeing this, K also agrees.

@Feltu
Wonderful. Please follow this path to join the farming team. Thank you—this place exists because of people like you（I appreciate you guys so much-this place...Please follow this path...）.

K and Xak walk down the main road. They see robots and humans living and working together. Soon, they arrive at the fields.

EXT. SCENE2 - DUSK - Autonomous Zone - Fields
A young woman is working in the field as Xak and K approach.

@K
Is there anything we can help with?

@Skull
New here?

K nods, as does Xak.

@Skull
Perfect. This area and over there need cleaning. And the cow shed—it reeks!(Good, you're here! This place and over there—clean it all up! And the cowshed too, it's reeking in there!)

@K
We’ll take care of it.

@Skull
Great. I’m beat—I’ll take a break(I need to take a break now).
(to Xak)
Hey, why aren’t you saying anything(you are not a talker, are you)?

@K
His voice module’s broken.

@Skull
(shrugs)
(Well in that case,)As long as he can work.

Xak heads toward the shed, and K follows.

INT. SCENE3 - DUSK - Autonomous Zone - Cow Shed
Xak picks up a tool from the ground and gestures to K.

@K
Got it. I’ll drive the cows out.

K grabs a stick and herds all the cows out of the shed. Skull is resting under a tree and calls out as K passes:

@Skull
Keep it up—I’m exhausted.

She then dozes off. K returns to the shed, puts down the stick, grabs a pressure washer, and begins cleaning. Once the shed is spotless, they herd the cows back in and head to Skull.

EXT. SCENE4 - DAY - Autonomous Zone - Fields
Skull is still sleeping. K walks over and says:

@K
The cow shed is cleaned. What else needs doing?

@Skull
(half-awake)
Oh, great. The barn’s leaking—go fix it.

She falls asleep again. Xak heads to the barn, with K following.

@K
She’s not doing anything, and we’re stuck with all the work...

Xak glances back at K but says nothing, climbing the barn ladder. K follows. They work together to fix the roof, then come down and return to Skull.

Skull is still asleep. K speaks up:

@K
Wake up—the barn’s fixed too.

She doesn’t respond. K raises his(her) voice:

@K
Hey! Wake up! Come on!

@Skull
(annoyed, waking)
Okay, okay.
(rubs her eyes)
All done?

@K
Shed and barn—everything’s done.

@Skull
You guys are quick.

@K
This isn’t fair. You’ve slept all day while we worked nonstop!

@Skull
(lights a cigarette)
No big deal.

K snatches the lighter away.

@K
Get up. You need to work too.

@Skull
(stands up)
Alright, alright—why so worked up(why so serious)?

She walks toward the center of the field, where chickens are running around in the overgrown grass. She kicks at the grass and tells Xak:

@Skull
You—bring the tractor. We need to clear this out.
(to K)
You—help me chase the chickens off so he can do his job.

@K
How?

@Skull
How? Use your hands, feet—just move ‘em!

Xak climbs into the tractor and drives it toward the field.

@Skull
Let’s go!

She runs after the chickens, shooing them away. K joins in. The two herd the chickens while Xak clears the weeds, forming bundles of straw.

Suddenly, a frightened chick bolts toward the moving tractor.

@Skull
Stop! Stop!

But the tractor’s roar drowns her out. K also yells:

@K
Xak! Xak!

Xak doesn’t hear. The tractor barrels forward. Skull rushes over but gets hit and falls. The tractor halts. Xak climbs down to find Skull lying on the ground, cradling the chick, groaning in pain. K rushes over.

Xak tries to help her up, but she shoves him away.

@K
Xak didn’t do it on purpose—you saw it, the tractor’s loud, and the weeds block visibility(the tractor was so loud that he could not hear it, and the weeds blocked his vision)…

@Skull
(gritting her teeth at Xak)
You did it on purpose!

@K
No—listen! He would never—

@Skull
He did it on purpose! He wants to kill me! Kill all humans!

@K
You’re framing him!

@Skull
(pulls out her wrist device)
Feltu! Get over here—I demand a public trial!

EXT. SCENE 5 - NIGHT - Autonomous Zone - Open-Air Assembly Center

A bonfire burns in the center of the open-air assembly. Most of the Autonomous Zone residents are seated around it. K notices that most of the humans here are young people and children. Skull sits to one side, his face bandaged, glaring menacingly at Xak, who stands next to K. Feltu steps into the center of the bonfire circle and begins to speak.

@Feltu
Thank you all for participating in tonight’s public arbitration. Now, will both parties please share their perspectives.

@Skull
I’ll go first!
(He walks to the bonfire center)
This afternoon, while working in the fields, Xak drove a tractor directly at me. Even though I shouted for it to stop, it acted like I didn’t exist—completely ignoring my cries and continuing to plow forward(Even though I shouted at him, he acted like I didn't exist-..).
(points at the scar on his face)
As you can see, I was injured. I believe Xak did this on purpose!

(The crowd erupts in gasps and chatter. Some shout, “No justice in the Autonomous Zone!” “Machines oppress humans!”)

@K
(stands to object)
I object! You’re not telling the full truth! At the time, Xak was driving the tractor, and the noise was deafening. On top of that, the weeds blew up and completely covered the windshield—it(he) couldn’t see a thing![对于xak的称呼是不是统一一下是“他”还是“它”？]

@Skull
Excuses!

@K
It’s the truth! Why won’t you believe me?

@Skull
If I remember correctly, your humanoid robot is a murder suspect, isn’t it?

@K
What does that have to do with Xak?

@Skull
Clearly, you were the one instructing it(him) behind the scenes.

@K
That’s not true.

@Feltu
Alright, alright—both of you, calm down. This arbitration is meant to resolve issues, not cause more conflict.

@Skull
Hmph! The facts are plain to see, and you’re still making excuses(Facts are facts)! If we don’t get justice today, this won’t end! I propose we expel Xak from the Autonomous Zone to appease public outrage!

@Feltu
Skull, please, calm down—

@Skull
Feltu, let’s be clear—I’m the victim here!

@Feltu
We need to face this issue together. Right now, we have two sides with conflicting stories—we can’t verify what truly happened…

@Skull
Fine, I get it! The so-called “Autonomous Zone” claims to be a new haven, but in reality, it just enables machines to trample on living beings! I propose we all leave this place right now! We won’t take this anymore!

(The other humans start agreeing loudly: “Yeah! Let’s leave!” “We’re done with the Autonomous Zone!”)

@Feltu
Wait—what are you doing? Please, everyone, calm down!

@Skull
Either give us an explanation, or don’t expect our cooperation!

@Feltu
Please don’t act impulsively!

(A voice from the crowd shouts, “There’s no justice in the Autonomous Zone!”)

(A man picks up a rock and hurls it at Xak, hitting his head. Xak stumbles back. K grabs a torch from the fire and rushes to shield Xak.)

@K
What do you think you’re doing!?

@Skull
I’m not after you—get out of the way. It’s him I want!

(Xak steps forward but K blocks him.)

@K
You’re not going anywhere!

@Skull
Then don’t blame me for what happens next!

@Feltu
Everyone calm down! Fighting is forbidden in the Autonomous Zone!

(Skull pulls out a small knife. Several others rush forward to attack K. K fends them off with the torch and engages Skull in a scuffle. During the fight, Skull slashes K’s face, but K sears Skull’s skin with the torch.)

(Skull screams, dropping the knife.)

@Skull
My hand! My hand!

@Feltu
(grabs K’s arm)
Enough! This must not happen in the Autonomous Zone!

@Skull
What more do you need to see!?

@Feltu
What’s most important right now is getting your hand treated. Both of you have violated our peace-first principle(You are both to blame — each of you has betrayed the very principle of peace and independence that governs this land). I ask both sides to take a step back. Xak will be punished, and I will provide a solution that satisfies everyone.

@Skull
Hmph. You’d better!

@Feltu
I promise.

(Skull clutches his injured hand and storms off.)

@Feltu
(to the crowd)
I apologize for what happened tonight. Clearly, there are unresolved tensions in our community(there are still many unresolved conflict exist in our community). Please give me some time—I will make things right.

(The humans disperse angrily, leaving only the AI robots.)

@Feltu
(to K)
If you two wish to stay here, you must formally apologize to Skull. She’s not unreasonable. I hope we can settle this civilly.(If you two wish to remain in the autonomous territory, you must offer a formal apology to Skull. She is not an unreasonable person — I truly hope we can resolve this matter in a civilized manner.)

(Xak nods, but K looks confused.)

@K
Feltu, she’s just taking advantage of the situation!

@Feltu
For the sake of peace, K, you must do it.

@K
And (what) if I refuse?

@Feltu
Then I’m afraid you’ll both have to leave.

(K looks like he wants to argue, but Xak gently pats his shoulder, signaling him to let it go.)

@K
Alright. I’ll apologize.

@Feltu
Good. Then it’s settled.

(Feltu leaves the bonfire. Xak gestures to K.)

@K
Got it. Let’s go.

INT. SCENE 6 - NIGHT - Autonomous Zone - Repair Center

K and Xak arrive at the repair center, where both humans and machines can receive medical attention. The area is split into sections for organic beings and machines. Skull lies in the human treatment section. Next to her is a frail young man with a nebulizer. They chat casually.

(Skull sees K and rolls her eyes, turning her back. Xak walks up to her clumsily and bows his head sincerely.)

@K
We came to apologize. I’m sorry.

(Skull says nothing.)

@K
Xak can’t speak, so he can’t express things with words—but he really is sorry.

(Skull looks at Xak. He extends his hand. She raises hers—not to shake, but to give him a light pat on the head.)

@Skull
(laughs softly)
This is fine too. Fewer things to worry about.

@K
I’m sure you’ll recover quickly.

@Skull
Of course!

(K relaxes as Skull softens. The three sit in silence. K gestures to the wheezing young man nearby and quietly asks Skull—)

@K
What… happened to him?

@Skull
Shh, keep it down…
(whispers)
Poor guy got into debt and couldn’t pay it back. The lenders beat him so badly he can’t live a normal life anymore. And he’s got a serious gambling addiction. His family and friends all cut ties.

@K
The human government doesn’t help?

@Skull
(shakes head)
They don’t care at all.

@K
So he came here?

@Skull
Yeah. Probably the last place that would still take him.

@K
I see.

@Skull
Anyway, let’s not talk about him. Can you tell me the story of your mask?

@K
I was a prototype in a humanoid experiment. Later, due to mismanagement, I lost my original face.

@Skull
Were you conscious at that point?

@K
No. One day, I woke up in a junk heap, surrounded by the corpses of my peers. That’s when I realized I didn’t have to obey anyone anymore.

@Skull
So you escaped?

@K
Exactly.

@Skull
What a story. If you'd been built a little later, maybe it wouldn’t have ended like this. I heard the human government is planning to approve humanoid robots for public use.

@K
Too bad I missed that chance.

@Skull
Before you came here, what did you do? I mean, what kind of service?

@K
Data management at a company. Boring, right?

@Skull
Eh, sitting in an office doesn’t sound so bad.

@K
What about you?

@Skull
Me? I wander from place to place. The world is my home.(A drifter at heart, making a home wherever the wind takes me.)

@K
Really? Doesn’t look like it.

@Skull
Believe what you want.
(points at Xak)
What about it? How did you two meet?

@K
Xak helped me escape from human pursuers. It brought me here.

@Skull
I see. I’ve always wondered—are you all just imitating humans? Or trying to improve on human civilization?

@K
We’re open to adapting to human norms—but many of those norms are built on AI sacrifice. What about you? Why did you come here?

@Skull
People like me don’t have steady income. One day I heard about this place—little work, decent food—I couldn’t resist.

@K
Got it.

@Skull
That’s how it is.
(nods)
You’re pretty tough. I hope we get a proper match someday.

@K
Me too.

(K’s wrist device beeps with a message from Feltu: “As punishment, both of you are to assist at the docks at 2 a.m. to receive a shipment.”)

(K looks at Xak. They nod, then leave the repair center and head for the docks.)

INT. SCENE7 - NIGHT - AUTONOMOUS ZONE - DOCK

It’s already late at night. The Autonomous Zone is silent. K and Xak arrive at the dock and see a freighter labeled with the characters “Yishang” (Foreign Traders) moored at the pier. A large cargo loader sits on the dock. Feltu is operating the loader, moving several large crates into the ship’s hold. Upon seeing K, Feltu begins to direct them.

@Feltu
You’re here. Go connect with the person in the work uniform over there—he’ll tell you what needs to be done.

@K
Got it.

K approaches the worker in the Yishang uniform on the dock. As K gets closer, he sees the worker holding a tablet, looking visibly impatient.

@Yishang Worker
Why are you so slow tonight? No one reliable left in this place, huh?
(Glancing over K)
Haven’t seen you around before.

@K
I just arrived at the Autonomous Zone.

@Yishang Worker
Yeah? Well, you won’t be staying long anyway.

@K
What do you mean by that?

@Yishang Worker
(Shrugs, changing the subject)
These—these are essentials: seeds, medicine, equipment—it’s all here.
(Kicks one of the crates)
And your precious placebos—crazy expensive. Don’t give out too much. Overdosing can be fatal.

@K
Placebos?

@Yishang Worker
(Suspiciously eyeing K)
They really let a newbie handle this… whatever. Just take this stuff back and tell V to contact our boss ASAP. We’ve got urgent matters to discuss.

@K
V?

@Yishang Worker
What, haven’t met it yet?

K shakes his head.

@Yishang Worker
No way—it should already be in the Autonomous Zone by now. Just take this back, follow my instructions exactly. Don’t screw it up, understand?

@K
Understood.

@Yishang Worker
Good. Be quick. Don’t let anyone find out. Or you’ll be in serious trouble.

@K
Alright.

The worker then shouts toward Feltu, who is still busy behind them.

@Yishang Worker
(Shouting)
Hey! You done yet?

@Feltu
(Shouting back)
There’s one more down here.

@Yishang Worker
(Stomping foot)
So slow.
(To K)
You—go drive that last one onto the ship.

@K
Yes.

K notices a cargo truck nearby with a huge container on it. He walks toward it and sees the rear compartment is unlocked. Curious, he opens the hatch and spots something reflective inside. Upon closer inspection, he sees a number of artificial intelligence robots packed inside.

Just as K is about to fully open the hatch to inspect further, Feltu rushes over and quickly slams it shut.

@Feltu
I’ll handle this. You go deliver the cargo to the storage room.

@K
What’s in here?

@Feltu
Don’t ask. Just do what I say.

Feltu climbs into the truck’s driver seat and drives it onto the freighter. The Yishang worker, seeing this, also turns and boards the ship, preparing to depart.

K and Xak turn to the remaining cargo and begin loading it onto the transport vehicle. They drive it to the location designated by Feltu. As they ride, K glances at the cargo in the back, a puzzled look on his face.

@K
The mysteries in this place just keep piling up… don’t you think?

Xak simply waves a hand, gesturing.

@K
I’m not overthinking it. You like this place, maybe blinded by appearances—but I’m sure… something’s not right here.
