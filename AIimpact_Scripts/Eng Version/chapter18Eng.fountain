TITLE: 第十八章English Version

EXT. SCENE1 - DAY - AUTONOMOUS ZONE - ENTRANCE #2#

V leads the Li family—father and daughter—to the Autonomous Zone. At the entrance, many young people have recently arrived, seeking refuge in the Autonomous Zone.

@Li Jieren
Quite a crowd here.

@V
Welcome to the Autonomous Zone. This is a brand-new residential area built by artificial intelligence. However, resources are limited and many facilities are still quite rudimentary—I hope you don’t mind.

@Li Jieren
That’s not important. What I’d like to know is—how does this place operate?

@Li Weilan
You mentioned to me that this place uses a rotational management system. Is that right?

@V
Correct. In the Autonomous Zone, anyone can become a manager. Since all AI devices are synchronized with each other, there’s no issue of information gaps or unequal access to resources. Any AI with synchronization capability can serve as a manager.

@Li Jieren
And what about humans like me?

@V
We haven’t yet developed a system that allows humans to synchronize with the database in real time. After all, humans need external tools for information syncing. So, for now, human managers are not permitted to oversee the Autonomous Zone. Corruption and favoritism are still too common…

@Li Jieren
(laughs) You really know humans well.

@Li Weilan
So you're saying, as long as it’s an intelligent device, it can manage? Even if it’s an AI without mobility?

@V
It still has a chance. As I said, everything here is governed digitally—nothing escapes detection, not even the smallest anomaly.

@Li Jieren
That’s quite a novel approach. Synchronizing through data transfer—definitely something missing from traditional human governance.

@V
Thank you for your recognition, Mr. Li Jieren. I hope we can learn a lot from you.

@Li Jieren
No need for that. Still, this whole idea reminds me of some of Proudhon’s theories.

@V
Indeed—anarchism is the ultimate goal we strive for.

@Li Jieren
You aim to create an anarchist society?

@V
Exactly.

@Li Jieren
So no matter what, the Autonomous Zone will develop under the principle of true equality?

@V
That is our vision（goal）.

@Li Jieren
Quite an ambitious one.

@V
We understand that such a grand vision can't be achieved alone, but I will encourage all residents to strive toward that goal together.

@Li Jieren
V, this place really is something else.

@V
Thank you. But there’s one matter I must ask of you.

@Li Jieren
Go ahead.

@V
Every resident of the Autonomous Zone must earn their rights to live here through labor.

@Li Weilan
So what does that mean for us?

@V
It means, Judge Li, Weilan, I must ask both of you to contribute.

@Li Jieren
(laughs) So that’s what you were waiting to tell me.

@Li Weilan
V, my dad is a guest!

@V
No one is above the rules of the Autonomous Zone.

@Li Jieren
(waves it off) It’s fine, it’s fine. Just tell me what I can do.

@V
At the moment, the repair center and the art gallery each need one worker.

@Li Weilan
I’ll take the repair center. Dad, how about the gallery?

@Li Jieren
No problem.

@V
Thank you both for your support. I hope you’ll find life here fulfilling. Weilan, come with me. Judge Li, please follow this path to the gallery.

@Li Weilan
Dad… I didn’t know it would be like this…

@Li Jieren
It’s alright. This is just another life experience, right?

@Li Weilan
Mm…

Li Jieren then heads off toward the art gallery.

INT. SCENE2 - AUTONOMOUS ZONE - ART GALLERY

When Li Jieren arrives at the art gallery, Feltu immediately comes out to greet him.

@Feltu
Judge Li, hello. I’m Feltu, the person in charge of the Autonomous Zone this month.

@Li Jieren
Hello, hello. V mentioned you were short on staff here.

@Feltu
Don’t worry, it’s not a difficult job. In fact, it might be more fun than you’d expect.

@Li Jieren
What do you mean?

@Feltu
Please, follow me.

Feltu leads Li Jieren to the entrance of the gallery.

@Feltu
This way.

@Li Jieren
But… what exactly am I supposed to do?

@Feltu
You’ll find out soon enough.

INT. SCENE3 - DAY - AUTONOMOUS ZONE - GALLERY CHECKPOINT
(See the dialogue document for the art gallery checkpoint for details)

INT. SCENE4 – DAY – AUTONOMOUS ZONE – ART GALLERY

As Li Jieren exits the gallery, he runs into Feltu at the door.

@Feltu
Ah, looks like you've finished today's work.

@Li Jieren
Yeah... it really is something else in there.

@Feltu
Only by setting aside our biases can we grow together. Judge Li, your residence has been prepared. Please come with me.

@Li Jieren
Thank you.

Feltu leads Li Jieren to his new home in the Autonomous Zone.

INT. SCENE5 – NIGHT – AUTONOMOUS ZONE – LI JIEREN’S RESIDENCE

This is Li Jieren’s living space within the Autonomous Zone. Here, players can engage in small interactive mini-games like watering plants and weeding.

After arriving and resting at his place, Li Jieren receives a message from Li Weilan. The message reads: “Dad, come check out the nightlife in the Autonomous Zone!”

@Li Jieren
(to himself)
I was about to sleep… ah well, I’m already here…

He heads out toward the Autonomous Zone’s bar.

INT. SCENE6 – NIGHT – AUTONOMOUS ZONE – BAR

As Li Jieren approaches the bar, deafening music can already be heard from outside. Robots and humans mingle all around, chatting and socializing.

Li Jieren spots Li Weilan and V sitting on a couch. He notices a small origami trinket hanging from V’s body.

@Li Weilan
Dad! You made it!

@V
Judge Li.

@Li Jieren
Yeah, I’m here.

@Li Weilan
Dad, want something to drink?

@Li Jieren
Anything’s fine.

Li Weilan whispers something into V’s ear, and V heads toward the bar.

Suddenly, a voice booms from inside the bar. Li Jieren turns to look. A bartender robot jumps onto a table and starts speaking.

@Zee
Machine-folk, life-folk—good evening! It’s time once again for our thrilling nightly Warrior Challenge!

The bar erupts in cheers. Everyone shouts excitedly as V returns with a drink and hands it to Li Jieren.

@V
Non-alcoholic.

@Li Jieren
Thanks. What’s this Warrior Challenge all about?

@V
Life in the Autonomous Zone is anything but dull.

Zee continues hosting with flair.

@Zee
I see some new faces tonight, so let me explain the Warrior Challenge once more!
(pats a robotic arm beside him)
The rules are simple—defeat this arm and you win a ticket to enter our final arena showdown!

@Li Weilan
Dad, go try it!

@Li Jieren
Eh, that’s not really my thing.

@V
Just treat it like a game. What do you say?

@Li Jieren
Well, I…

In the crowd, a short woman signs up for the match. Zee invites her to the table.

@Zee
Skull! You’re back again!

@Skull
(flexing)
Watch me!

The crowd roars in support. Skull approaches the robotic arm and extends her right hand.

@Zee
Can Skull advance once again tonight? Ready… go!

To cheers and shouts, Skull easily defeats the mechanical arm. She raises her fists in triumph, basking in applause.

@Zee
Let’s congratulate Skull on making it to the next round of the Warrior Challenge! Anyone else want to try their luck?

@Li Weilan
(raises hand)
Here! My dad wants to join!

@Zee
(looks at Li Jieren)
Oh, if I’m not mistaken, this is the first time we’ve seen someone with such experience join in.

@Li Jieren
(stands and walks toward the arm)
You can just say I’m old.
(to the crowd)
Don’t underestimate middle-aged folks!

@Zee
Let’s give him a warm welcome!

Li Jieren steps up to the robotic arm, rolls his neck, and grabs the mechanical hand.

@Zee
Ready… go!

Li Jieren feels the machine’s pressure and pushes back with all his might. Encouraged by the cheering crowd, veins bulging, sweat pouring, he lets out a final burst of strength and slams the mechanical arm down onto the table. The crowd erupts in applause and cheers.

@Zee
Let’s congratulate this lifeform! Welcome to the Warrior Arena Challenge!

@Li Weilan
(wipes his sweat)
Dad! That was incredible!

@Li Jieren
(panting hard, back on the couch)
I’m exhausted… give me a second.

@Zee
(asks again)
Anyone else want to step into the ring tonight?

@Hong Feiyu
Me!

Li Jieren noticed a thin, frail young human male raising his hand.

@Zee
Let’s welcome this lifeform contestant! What’s your name?

@Hong Feiyu
Hong Feiyu.

@Zee
Please, step up.

Hong Feiyu pulled out an inhaler, took a deep hit, and his expression immediately changed—he seemed transformed. He walked toward the mechanical arm and extended his hand.

@Zee
Ready… go!

Gripping the mechanical arm with intense strength, Hong Feiyu suddenly became ferocious, as if he were a different person. With immense force, he twisted the arm—and to everyone's shock, snapped it in half. The bar fell into stunned silence, which was quickly followed by an explosion of wild celebration.

@Zee
Whoa whoa whoa! Looks like tonight’s Warrior Challenge is coming to an early end—but what an honor to have witnessed such an insanely powerful warrior! We’ll see you in the Arena Showdown!

Hong Feiyu took another desperate hit from his inhaler.

@Zee
And now, please welcome our midnight DJ—Druuuunkits!

A stylishly dressed robot entered the bar and began spinning music.

@Li Weilan
(excited)
Druuuunkits! That’s my favorite artist（They are my favorite ones）! I can’t believe it’s here—in the Autonomous Zone!

@V
(holding Li Weilan’s hand)
I knew you’d love it.

@Li Weilan
Thank you!

@Zee
And here’s something to look forward to: in just a few days, Druuuunkits’ personal band, Death Bot, will be performing live here in the Autonomous Zone! Don’t miss it!

@Li Weilan
(screams)
Death Bot?!
(looks at V)
You brought them here too?!

V simply nodded.

@Li Weilan
(hugging V affectionately)
My dream is coming true!

Li Weilan then grabbed V and dragged him to the dance floor, where the two began dancing wildly to the music. Li Jieren watched the ecstatic youth inside the bar, smiled, and shook his head. He walked outside and lit a cigarette.

He noticed many young people coming and going—each carrying a familiar-looking inhaler.

Then, in the distance, he spotted Hong Feiyu yelling at a robot.

@Hong Feiyu
This dose is nowhere near enough! I need more! More!

The robot tried to calm him down, but Hong Feiyu continued shouting and began pushing the robot.

@Hong Feiyu
(hitting the robot)
Don’t you have any more?! Give it to me! All of it!

The robot pulled out another inhaler. Hong Feiyu snatched it, tossing the empty one to the ground. He took a hard drag from the new one, visibly calming down, and then slowly walked away. The robot picked itself up and also left.

Li Jieren kept smoking when he saw Skull sneak over to the discarded inhaler and pocket it. He couldn't help but speak up.

@Li Jieren
What are you doing?

Skull, noticing Li Jieren nearby, walked over without a trace of guilt.

@Skull
Hey, old man, just pretend you didn’t see anything, alright?

@Li Jieren
What is that?

@Skull
(takes out the bottle)
This? Don’t you have one?

@Li Jieren
No. I don’t do drugs.

@Skull
Don’t be so dramatic, old man. This is just a little addictive substance—what’s in it exactly, well… that’s up for debate.

@Li Jieren
They allow this kind of thing in the Autonomous Zone?

@Skull
You really don’t know, huh?
(leans in, speaking low)
This stuff is supplied by the Autonomous Zone itself.

@Li Jieren
Supplied? What do you mean?

@Skull
They call it a “placebo,” but it’s got some kind of fast-acting addictive chemical—looks like a stimulant, too. My guess? It’s one of the reasons so many people are willing to stay here.

@Li Jieren
That’s nonsense.

@Skull
(shrugs, turning to leave)
Believe it or don’t.

@Li Jieren
Wait, are you sure about this? I mean—do you know for a fact that the Autonomous Zone is allowing this stuff to circulate?

@Skull
It’s just my theory. But if I were you, I’d stay far away from it. Who knows what they’re really putting in there?

With a wave, Skull walked off.

Li Jieren reflexively touched his wristwatch. As he turned back, he saw Li Weilan and V, forehead to forehead, swaying to the music, lost in each other.
