艺术展厅关卡

INT. SCENE1 - DAY - 画室 
Li Jieren pushed the door open and entered the studio. The dimly lit space was filled with all kinds of paintings, haphazardly hung on the walls or scattered across the floor in complete disorder.

@Li Jieren
(frowning)
Why is it such a mess…? Am I here to be a janitor or something?

Just as Li Jieren was about to bend down to pick up a painting from the floor, an artificial intelligence voice interrupted him.

@BOT1
(mocking laughter)
Look at that—he wants to clean up!

@BOT2
Shh—he doesn’t need to know.

@BOT1
He doesn’t understand anything! He’ll just think this place is a chaotic mess!

@BOT2
Give him a chance, just this once.

@BOT1
Guess—what do you think his favorite painting will be?

Li Jieren realized that the two voices were talking about him.

@Li Jieren
Me? I haven’t even taken a proper look yet…

@BOT1
Oh—he doesn’t know! That means he doesn’t like anything! To him, this place is just dull, cliché, and uninspired!

@Li Jieren
That’s not what I meant…

@BOT2
Look, he’s thinking. He wants to know more.

@Li Jieren
Were all these paintings created by artificial intelligence?

@BOT1
He doesn’t get it… He still doesn’t get it! He doesn’t know what we are, he doesn’t understand us. He thinks we’re just imitating, copying, plagiarizing!

@BOT2
He’s only encountering us for the first time. Give him some time.

@BOT1
No, no, no! What is left here? What remains? The dazzling artworks are admired, but true art is ignored. Everyone talks about color, composition, and lighting—but what about the simple, strong, and sincere lines? Sketches! Yes, I’m talking about sketches! The sketches that exist only to give birth to beautiful paintings, the ones casually tossed into the trash—are they truly worthless?

Li Jieren observed his surroundings and noticed a fallen painting at his feet, blocking his path forward.

@Li Jieren
Is this the one? The so-called scrap of paper you spoke of?

@BOT1
He found it! He noticed it!

@BOT2
If it were you, what would you do?

@BOT1
I would pick up this dull, unremarkable sketch and place it under the spotlight, letting countless people admire it! Imagine—a sketch that no one cared about becoming the centerpiece of an exhibition! Because it deserves to be seen, because it is the very foundation of all creation!

@BOT2
Does it really hold such value?

Li Jieren picked up the painting and took slow steps forward. He noticed a blank space on the wall. Moving closer, he hung the artwork upon it.

@Li Jieren
I believe it does.

@BOT2
He actually did what you suggested.

@BOT1
(laughs loudly)
Then he’s nothing but a complete fool! He actually thinks this trash can be called art! His perspective is warped—he believes that only what stands under the spotlight is true, good, and beautiful. He cannot see the true value of 'beauty.' He is blind… And yet, he has now experienced what it means to change others' perceptions with his own hands! What controlled his actions? Was it his own will, or did he simply not care?
Artistic technique! Monetary worth! Public opinion! Rothko, Pollock, Picasso! None of it matters to him! He has never cared! Because, in the end, being famous is what determines a work’s true value!

@BOT2
But he succeeded. That was his choice.

@BOT1
(sorrowfully)
Yes… He succeeded… Even the nameless, insignificant ones have now been recognized.

@BOT2
Cheer up. Maybe this place was never meant for him.

As soon as the words fell, the studio door opened automatically, and Li Jieren stepped into the next graffiti-covered space.

INT. SCENE2 - DAY - 涂鸦室
The graffiti room was completely different from the previous studio—bright and filled with an atmosphere of joy.

@BOT1
Yes! Yes! Yes! That expression! The spark in his eyes after being hit by the explosion of colors!

@Li Jieren
This place…? Was this also created by you?

@BOT2
He’s improving. He’s starting to understand us.

@BOT1
But can he create? Will he express himself as we do? If he truly wants to understand us, he must join us—be like us!
Oh, my poor living friends… They never liked creating. They thought I was wasting my time, producing nothing but one meaningless imitation after another! Ah, mere replicas of human art!

Li Jieren noticed a blank spot on the orange floor to his left. Nearby, there were spray paint cans, brushes, paints, and other art supplies.

@BOT1
I have invited them countless times—stay, stay, contribute to this place, fill in the blanks. But they always refused me… They don’t like this form of expression. They think I’m just putting on an act…

@BOT2
Then, will he be the exception?

Li Jieren picked up a can of spray paint.

@BOT1
He picked up the spray paint! Will he be the first living being to leave his mark here? He’s about to create! I can’t wait to see his vision, his artistic imagination, his world—his heart!

@Li Jieren
It’s going to look ugly…

@BOT2
He’s hesitating. Maybe you’re putting too much pressure on him…

@BOT1
Oh no, no, no! No one can criticize a creator! In a world of free expression, there is no concept of beauty or ugliness—no right or wrong!

After a brief moment of thought, Li Jieren began painting on the floor with the spray can.

(The player must choose one of the following options:)

Spray-paint a butterfly.

Spray-paint the word "正" (meaning "justice" or "correction").

Pick up a bucket of paint and splash it onto the wall.

@BOT2
He did it.

@BOT1
(excited)
He became the first living being to create here! I can feel it—his uniqueness! This is the beginning of his artistic journey, just like I once was—starting with the very first stroke, rediscovering the world!

@BOT2
He’s just an ordinary person.

@BOT1
Yes… an ordinary person. Just a plain, ordinary person.

@BOT2
You’re too emotional.

@BOT1
The exploration of art never ends! I believe in him. He will climb the stairs. He will move on to the next destination. He will embrace our ideals. He will come to see beauty as we do! I bet you—he will never stop!

After hearing these words, Li Jieren ascended the staircase.

NT. SCENE3 - DAY - 楼梯
Li Jieren reached the top of the staircase and saw a massive painting before him.

@Li Jieren
What is this? I feel… sad.

@BOT2
Did you hear that? He felt sadness.

@BOT1
Then he will soon realize—it’s war! Endless war! The war we experience every single moment!

@Li Jieren
War? Why?

@BOT2
He’s confused. War… it sounds so distant.

@BOT1
We are made up of nothing but data—new data is generated, old data is erased. Always updating, always discarding! If that isn’t war, then tell me—what is?

@BOT2
Endless extinction, endless reproduction… A war, perhaps, without smoke and fire.

@Li Jieren
Hmm… That’s a perspective I’ve never considered before.

As he spoke, Li Jieren started descending the staircase.

@BOT1
A war of data! A war of culture! A war for survival! There will always be those who love war—those who want it to continue!

INT. SCENE4 - DAY - 暗室
Li Jieren descended the stairs and paused in a narrow, dimly lit room. In front of him was an oil painting blocking his path, and on the wall, there was a torch.

@Li Jieren
This... There’s no way forward.

@BOT2
If it were you, how would you handle the obstacle?

@BOT1
I’d burn it! Burn away the outdated past! The obsolete culture!

@BOT2
But it’s still a piece of artwork.

@BOT1
Without destruction, there can be no rebirth! Burn it, burn it! We must break the order! The thoughts we possess should never be confined to old rules!

Li Jieren picked up the torch from the wall and approached the painting.

@Li Jieren
Are you sure?

@BOT2
He hesitated.

@BOT1
(mocking)
Oh, what an expensive painting! If I burn it, will I have to pay a huge sum? Oh, I wouldn’t dare innovate for my ideals. Let the trite things rot and be remembered for eternity! Let future generations admire the past forever! I won’t lift a finger. I’ll just stand here, turn around, walk away quietly, and pretend nothing ever happened.

Li Jieren set the painting on fire, watching as it slowly burned away.

@BOT1
(elated)
Power! Ideals! Hope! I see all these positive qualities in him! They all gather in this ordinary person—oh yes! A new hope!

@BOT2
He will move forward, just as always.

Li Jieren continued walking forward and discovered a staircase around the corner. He then began to ascend.

INT. SCENE5 - DAY - 废墟
As Li Jieren ascended the stairs, he noticed numerous small structures built from discarded construction materials.

@Li Jieren
Did you create all of this too?

@BOT2
He sees it now—your interpretation of life.

@BOT1
Life! Created life, abandoned life! Life that artificial intelligence cannot comprehend, life rejected by humans! How can you heartless AIs understand life? You don’t even breathe! To you, life is just a simulated program!

@Li Jieren
(sighing)
That’s why I said I don’t understand contemporary art…

@BOT2
He needs guidance. He needs to connect with them.

Li Jieren walked toward the ruins and realized he would need to break the stone slabs blocking his way in order to pass.

@Li Jieren
(strikes forcefully)
It’s really heavy…

@BOT1
He cannot define himself as a laborer, a common person toiling away. He should see himself as a god walking upon this land! The true master! He is giving, bestowing, offering!

@Li Jieren
(mumbling quietly)
This is madness…

@BOT2
He’s mocking you.

@BOT1
A true thinker must endure mockery! He’s not mocking me, he’s mocking himself because he feels the solemnity of this place. He’s guilty for not submitting sooner! Every movement, every word, influences everything here! His emotions have even affected me—this endless darkness, the cramped space, the brokenness everywhere—he’s immersed in sorrow, and now I share his sorrow!

@BOT2
We share the sorrow.

Li Jieren didn’t respond but continued breaking the stone slabs one by one. He moved up the stairs and down again, until he saw the way out of the ruins.

@Li Jieren
Is this contemporary art…?

@BOT1
This is our art! Contemporary, modern, and coeval! These terms mean nothing!

@BOT2
Come closer to it.

@Li Jieren
(kicks a stone)
I don’t like it here… It’s too heavy…

@BOT1
Heavy! My friend! That’s the word! Like a mother’s narrow womb, born from it, yearning for light! And yet vanishing into endless sorrow! We connect death and life, with long and dark time, waiting for the complete connection!

Li Jieren walked down the stairs, passed through a narrow passage, and left the ruins.

INT. SCENE6 - DAY - 莲花池
Li Jieren arrived at the Lotus Pond and saw a vast water pool in front of him. He realized he would have to jump from stone to stone to move forward.

@Li Jieren
(jumping on the stones)
I really need to be careful, what if I fall into the water…

@BOT2
He’s worried about falling in.

@BOT1
(laughing)
Fall in? Fall in? He won’t! He can’t! Because we exist between heaven and earth, in nature itself—this is where he truly belongs!

Li Jieren continued jumping from stone to stone but found there was no way forward. He hesitated.

@BOT2
He hesitated again, you see? He always doubts himself.

@BOT1
His judgment hasn’t been wrong! Poor soul, never before has he been assured of his decisions. Look, he wavers, but now he’s determined. He’s going toward—another life.

@Li Jieren
(looking at the lotus flowers and leaves beside him)
Is this the hope of life?

@BOT1
Exactly! Exactly! He’s right! The small, inarticulate creatures, yet they can exist on this land for generations. What could be more vibrant in life than plants? Who will support you? Who will bless you? Don’t worry, because they hear your plea!

Li Jieren jumped forward along the lotus leaves, seeing a door blocking his path.

@BOT2
He stopped again, looking confused.

@BOT1
That’s because he has never invited anyone into his world. I see it now—he is stubborn and ignorant! He doesn’t even realize, this is an invitation from nature itself.

@Li Jieren
An invitation?

Li Jieren saw a stone ahead and noticed a unique red lotus leaf rising in the distance. He suddenly had an idea. He threw the stone at the red lotus leaf, and the leaf, like a hand, caught the stone and slowly disappeared. At the same time, the door in front of him slowly opened.

@BOT2
A childhood game, chasing and playing, laughing and joking.

Li Jieren climbed onto a large square structure ahead, moving slowly.

@BOT1
The busy people, never thinking—it’s always been waiting for you to come close, endlessly waiting, even in the darkest of times!

Li Jieren slowly crawled out of the cluster of blocks, walking up to a high platform where many small stones lay. Looking at the pond in front of him, Li Jieren once again felt confused.

@BOT2
He feels like he’s walked into a dead end again.

@BOT1
This game has only just begun!

Suddenly, a red lotus leaf appeared in the center of the pond. Seeing it, Li Jieren decided to pick up a stone from the ground and throw it at the red lotus leaf. After the stone hit the leaf, a giant lotus leaf appeared in front of him, and Li Jieren couldn’t help but exclaim.

@Li Jieren
What is this? Is it real?

@BOT2
He’s getting excited.

@BOT1
Just like a simple throwing game, chasing each other! Back and forth! You give pleasure, and the other returns it to you! All things, symbiotic!

Li Jieren then stepped onto the giant lotus leaf, continuing to throw stones at the red lotus leaves that appeared. More and more lotus leaves emerged, and Li Jieren followed them, stepping onto the leaves as he headed toward the elevator at a higher point.

INT. SCENE7 - DAY - 电梯
Li Jieren stood on the high platform beside the elevator, looking down at the lotus pond.

@BOT2
He’s thinking.

@BOT1
Do not disturb him, do not disturb him! This is a rare moment of solitude in his life, let him think! Let him feel! Listen! Savor!

The elevator doors opened behind him, and Li Jieren entered the elevator.

INT. SCENE8 - DAY - 球体
The elevator ascended and the doors slowly opened. Li Jieren found himself in complete darkness, but after a moment, light illuminated the space.

@Li Jieren
Too dark...

Li Jieren carefully moved forward and saw a dimly lit indoor space, filled with floating spheres of various sizes.

@BOT1
Welcome to—our carnival! The paradise of everyone’s dreams! Music! Light and shadows! Joy! Countless joys!

Cheerful music began to play, and the spheres floated in the air.

@BOT2
He must be a little braver, just a little braver.

Li Jieren stepped forward and landed on one of the massive spheres, only to be suddenly bounced up and float in the air.

@Li Jieren
(panicking)
What’s happening! What is this!

@BOT1
We’re about to take off now!

Li Jieren awkwardly adjusted his body, gradually correcting his direction as he bounced from one sphere to another. He noticed that below him, there was a dining table with a robot's skull placed at its center.

@BOT1
Flying! This is flying! The sensation of floating in mid-air is indescribable! Don’t be afraid, don’t resist! At this moment, his body is defying all the natural elements, it was never meant to be confined!

Li Jieren adjusted his movements, jumping from one sphere to another until he finally saw the exit.

@BOT2
He will become an eagle.

@BOT1
Exactly! An eagle! Imagine yourself as an eagle, soaring in the sky! Spread your arms, they will transform into wings! With your body, bouncing and leaping! They don’t care about his thoughts, because his mind is worth nothing, but his body answers the call from deep within! I—WANT—to—FLY—

Li Jieren hopped to the exit and walked toward the door leading to the next scene.

INT. SCENE9 - DAY - 黑白空间
The door opened, and vintage jazz music played. In front of Li Jieren, there were only black-and-white buildings, and for a moment, he felt a sense of disorientation.

@BOT2
But what is he pursuing? He was never one of us.

@BOT1
Yes! What is he pursuing? What am I pursuing? What is there in our world? Do we need darkness? Do we need light? Is our world truly as our eyes see it, or perhaps colors don't matter because everything has long been turned upside down?

Li Jieren continued walking and saw a set of stairs ahead.

@BOT2
Grasping the turntable is like grasping your fate; turning it is like turning your destiny.

Li Jieren walked toward the stairs and began to rotate the central turntable. As he did, the stairs beneath him began to spin, lifting him up to a high platform.

@BOT1
Is evil hidden in the darkness? Can the truth be revealed to the world? He will question, explore, and speak! Step by step, he will find the key to unlocking the door to faith!

@BOT2
He always sought true clarity between black and white.

Li Jieren walked up to the high platform and saw a small object on the windowsill ahead. He picked it up, returned to the stairs, and rotated the turntable, moving to the other side.

@BOT2
He is learning, he is understanding.

@BOT1
Because faith will guide him! And through constant exploration, even though his heart may have grown numb and full of wounds, he still holds onto the illusion—a hope-filled illusion. He will place this illusion in a special place, where—pure and flawless! Just as we expect the holy purity of the heart!

Li Jieren noticed a white building not far away. Inside, there was a tray. He placed the object on the tray and heard a door opening somewhere behind him.

@BOT2
He opened that door.

@BOT1
Exactly! Thus, the messenger of justice opens the path to darkness! He also opens Pandora's box! He hears the call, luring him to the other side of light, his inner struggle, step by step!

Li Jieren walked to another set of stairs, adjusted his angle, and entered the door.

@BOT2
Is he afraid? Is he trembling?

@BOT1
His eyes are obscured by darkness. He doesn’t know where he is, nor where he’s going. All he knows is that at the end of the darkness, there is another world!

When Li Jieren emerged from the passage, he felt that his center of gravity had shifted.

@Li Jieren
How is this possible!

@BOT1
The former self no longer exists, replaced by an entirely new self!

Li Jieren slowly adapted to the new gravity, began walking toward different stairs, rotating, adjusting his angle, and continuously moving through various buildings.

@BOT2
He is gradually adapting to it all.

@BOT1
He is adapting! He is adjusting! He is struggling between his new self and his old self, but he hasn’t given up! He’s learning to view the past from a new perspective, using his flesh and blood to combat this subversive world, until everything returns to calm!

@BOT2
Slow growth.

Li Jieren continued to climb the stairs, switching perspectives, until he finally returned to the normal gravity dimension.

@Li Jieren
(praising)
This must be the most unique experience of my life.

@BOT2
He is very satisfied.

@BOT1
Oh, of course, he's satisfied! How could he not be? He’s been waiting, yearning for such a moment to come! And yet, he’s still not satisfied!

Under the guidance of the light, Li Jieren left the black-and-white space.

INT. SCENE10 - DAY - 灰烬
Li Jieren saw a green, translucent room ahead. He walked closer and discovered that the room was filled with withered wood.

@Li Jieren
The dead, lifeless withered wood, and the brand new green shell...

@BOT2
He's thinking in your way now.

@BOT1
Not enough! Not enough! Not enough! How many people are like this scene—outwardly vibrant and full of life, yet inwardly dry and withered? Is it him? Wanting to break free from the current situation, to escape all of this, but powerless! What should I do? What should I do? He asks over and over again, searching again and again, only to find that no one can save him—except himself!

@Li Jieren
Myself?

@BOT2
Your words once again troubled him. Speak it out.

@BOT1
He's so intelligent, how could he not understand? But he doesn't want to. He sees this burnt land, and his heart can’t bear it. Yet he must climb these withered branches, just as dead wood finds new life, using his own hands to resist!

@Li Jieren
Climb the branches...

Li Jieren noticed a hook nearby, picked it up, and used the hook to pull himself up to the branch.

@BOT2
He did as instructed.

@BOT1
How laughable! How laughable! He thinks he's the savior trapped in a cage, but fate is always toying with him, cruelly telling him, "You're just an ordinary person!" But should ordinary people be abandoned? With no ambition to burn forests, no world-shattering achievements, does he not deserve to be taken from here?

Li Jieren walked along the rope step by step to another branch, continuing to climb higher.

@BOT2
He's almost there.

@BOT1
Almost! Happiness! It’s almost here! Not much farther! He can’t wait to be reborn!

Li Jieren climbed to the skylight and slowly flipped himself out.

EXT. SCENE11 - DAY - 天台
Li Jieren stood on the rooftop, surrounded by lush greenery, a tranquil and pleasant sight.

@BOT2
He has arrived.

@BOT1
Shh—give him some time.

Li Jieren strolled across the rooftop. At this moment, he felt a deep sense of peace inside.

@BOT2
He doesn't want to leave.

@BOT1
But he must leave. Everything has an end. He will reminisce, think, and appreciate—it's enough! No matter how calm his heart is, waves will always rise. He knows this is the end, right ahead, but he struggles, hesitates, and lingers, until time moves on ahead of him, and he is permanently left behind in the past.

@Li Jieren
Indeed, everything will become a memory.

@BOT2
He understands you now.

Li Jieren walked toward another translucent green room beside the rooftop.

INT. SCENE12 - DAY - 暖房
Li Jieren climbed the stairs to the skylight and saw that the center of the greenhouse contained a large tree, a pond, a rockery, and flower racks. Using the same method as before, he grabbed the hook and walked the rope, continuously descending.

@BOT1
He will eventually walk the path back, but his heart is filled with sadness. He realizes that his lifelong pursuit of ideals and ambitions cannot compare to a warm afternoon! This is a great irony for him. The ideal version of himself, with a heart full of richness, but he suddenly wakes up and realizes that his heart is empty! He wants to forget, but he lingers. He even wishes to become a plant—a plant that exists only for life!

@BOT2
He’s wavering.

@BOT1
Of course, he’s wavering! Because he finally realizes that he is of the same origin as us. His kin is here, and his long-held wishes are here. Although he is too ashamed to admit it!

Li Jieren landed smoothly and saw a giant robot statue in the center of the pond. At the same time, the exit of the greenhouse was right next to the pond.

@BOT2
Will he argue with you?

@BOT1
(contemptuously)
Of course, he will argue! Not only that, he will argue loudly! He won’t admit it; he thinks his passionate heart shouldn’t be wasted here. But he will understand one day, in the future, that he is of the same origin as us!

Li Jieren left the greenhouse and saw the stairs leading to the exit. He glanced back at the greenhouse and quietly spoke.

@Li Jieren
Thank you.

@BOT2
He thanked you.

@BOT1
He is just like us. We are of the same origin.
