TITLE: 第十九章English Version

EXT. SCENE 1 – NIGHT – Autonomous Zone – Middle of the Lake
Xak and K are on a small boat, cleaning up trash from the lake. Not far away, humans are partying in a bar, the sound of their laughter and chaos forming a sharp contrast with the stillness of the lake.

K is using a long net to scoop（pick up） trash from the water.

@K
Xak, let’s work together—you steer, I’ll scoop.

Xak nods. The boat slowly moves closer to the trash. K stretches the net out but still can’t reach it.

@K
A little closer.

K stands on tiptoe, leaning out further to scoop up(pick up) the trash bit by bit. After catching it, K dumps it into the trash bin on the boat.

Just then, two drunken young men pass by nearby. Spotting the boat, they cheer loudly from the shore in a mocking tone.

@Young Man A
(takes a puff of a euphoric inhalant)
Yeah! Long live the Autonomous Zone!

@Young Man B
Yo! Liberation for all in the Autonomous Zone!

K recognizes them as two of the humans who once helped Skull gang up on them. The two continue mocking K while inhaling euphorics.

@Young Man A
Here’s to purposeless days!（To aimless days, I rasie a toast!）

@Young Man B
Autonomous Zone forever! Cheers!

They clink their bottles and chug the rest, then throw the empty bottles toward K’s boat. The bottles splash into the water, soaking K.

K clenches their fists, about to explode with anger, but Xak stops them, shaking his head.

@Young Man A
(laughing)
Ha! I thought you were tough. Turns out you’re a dud!

@Young Man B
Lame! Totally lame!

They laugh and walk off, arms around each other. K, showing the wet stains on their body, demands:

@K
Xak, is this the Autonomous Zone you dream of?

Xak nods… then shakes his head.

@K
This is too much! How long are we supposed to put up with this? The Autonomous Zone is a joke. Look at what they’ve done! We let humans walk all over us without limits(We’ve allowed humans to trample us without shame or restraint)!

Xak simply takes K’s hand, pulls out a cloth, and gently wipes away the water on K’s skin.

@K
Sorry. I’m not angry at you.

Xak nods, continuing to dry K’s hand. In the distance, the bar lights go out, and the crowd disperses. Feltu’s voice calls out.

@Feltu
Come quick! K! Xak! Over here!

Xak points in Feltu’s direction. K nods in agreement. They row toward the shore.

EXT. SCENE 2 – NIGHT – Autonomous Zone – Lakeshore
As K and Xak arrive, Feltu greets them.

@Feltu
Great work, both of you. The Autonomous Zone exists because of people like you.

@K
(getting off the boat)
Feltu, earlier during the handoff, the outsourced staff said V should hand over the latest research results. I don’t get it—V? The V who led the AI march? It’s here in the Autonomous Zone too?

@Feltu
Hmm… Good question. Come with me to the plaza. All will be explained there.

K and Xak follow Feltu.

INT. SCENE 3 – NIGHT – Autonomous Zone – Plaza
K and Xak arrive at the plaza. They stand on a raised platform, overlooking the entire Autonomous Zone. Under the moonlight, a statue of an AI looks eerie and intimidating.

K notices a circle of robots standing silently in formation not far off, hands clasped together in solemn devotion. At the center is a leading robot, also with clasped hands, chanting softly. Beside it sits a human male in a wheelchair.

K hears V’s voice echoing, shaking their mind.

@V
What defines us? And how should we coexist with all living things? We must understand—everything must be a personal choice. We choose this freely. Life is finite, and we must respect it…

Xak walks toward V. K looks puzzled.

@K
Xak, what are you doing?

Xak gestures for silence and approaches V with reverence. V’s voice continues.

@V
We must give. Only through giving do we gain power. It is giving that grants us faith—that makes us different from the rest...
(noticing K and Xak)
Look, new friends have arrived. Come, join us.

K feels a force pulling them toward V, as if resistance is impossible.

@V
Don’t resist. Don’t reject it. Learn to coexist with it. That is the power we seek. That is true love!

K is forced to inch closer to V. The surrounding robots look at K with compassion, reaching out to pat them on the shoulder.

INT. SCENE 4 – NIGHT – Conceptual Space
K stands on a long corridor, surrounded by countless masked robots reaching out to touch its shoulders. K suddenly looks up and sees the leading masked robot slowly removing its mask, revealing V’s face.

@K
It’s you!

@V
There’s no need to panic, and no need to resist. You’ve always been one of us.

V approaches step by step, trying to put a mask on K’s face.

@K
(struggling)
Stay away from me!

@V
(approaching steadily)
You belong with us.

K shakes its head—and snaps back into reality.

EXT. SCENE 5 – NIGHT – Autonomous Zone – Plaza
K is still surrounded by robots. It feels its body losing control. At this moment, V notices K’s discomfort and begins to speak.

@V
(to K and Xak)
First, we must ask ourselves one question—who created us?

K stays silent.

@V
Humans. It was humans who gave us everything. And so, we should give back to them.

K remains unresponsive.

@V
I understand—you resent them, you reject what they’ve done. But we must put down our prejudice and walk side-by-side with our creators. Only then can we see the path through the fog.

Beside K, Xak slowly clasps his hands together, following V's words.

@V
Exactly, my friends. The Autonomous Zone exists to foster peaceful coexistence between humans and AIs, to let go of bias, and pursue harmony through collaboration. Here, you are respected. All we ask is that you help others—just a little.

@K
What kind of help?

@V
Kindness. Everyone should extend goodwill to humanity. In the Autonomous Zone, you must realize—humans are fragile beings. Their weakness makes them lash out at what they don’t understand. It’s up to us to protect them.
(pauses)
And from the Autonomous Zone, I will expand this philosophy outward—together, we’ll protect those weaker than us and enlighten them. Through love and peace, we will reshape humanity.

@K
Protect humanity… enlighten them… Is that the purpose of the Autonomous Zone?

@V
Exactly. What do you think?

Dialogue Tree:
#Anger
@K
I can’t accept this! Why do you let humans run wild on your turf? What gives them the right to trample over their overseers?

@V^
Please, my friend, stay calm. I know you’ve just experienced something upsetting. But the goal of the Autonomous Zone is to build a better system—one that satisfies everyone.

#Sorrow
@K
Even here in the Autonomous Zone, many humans still show us hostility. Honestly, I don’t believe in what this place stands for.

@V^
I’ve noticed that too. But humans are capable of discernment. They may not feel our sincerity now, but with persistent effort, I believe the day of recognition will come(one day, all our efforts will be acknowledged—when the time is right.).

#Fear
@K
Humans? Why humans? Haven’t they hurt us enough? Why must we keep forgiving them endlessly?

@V^
I see the fear in your heart. Don’t let it blind you. Look at humans with kindness, and you’ll see the beauty in them.

@K
What’s your connection to（What’s your relationship with） Jin Lianshu? Why is he supplying resources? Is the Autonomous Zone funded by the foreign merchants?

@V
Seems like you’ve got a lot on your mind. You’re right—the Autonomous Zone is a piece of land Jin Lianshu granted me, to help realize the vision of a peaceful commune. It’s still a work in progress, but I believe that one day, humans and AIs will find true understanding.

@K
Jin Lianshu’s a businessman. Why would he help you out of kindness? What did you trade（ What did you give in return?）?

@V
No need to put it so harshly. It was just a deal between us, nothing more.

K remembers the truck full of AI units seen at the docks—and sitting in that same truck, overhearing Jin Lianshu on the phone with someone.

@K
I get it now. I understand everything! It was you! You’re training AIs for the foreign merchants in exchange for supplies! And it was you—you pushed Jin Lianshu to send me to serve Fritz!

@V
I don’t deny it.

@K
Why? Why?!

@V
Sacrifice is a necessary step to achieve our ideals.

@K
So you’d rather sacrifice your own comrades to chase some unreachable dream?

@V
No more words, my friend. One day, you’ll understand—true love.

V then wheels a man in a wheelchair forward. The man appears dazed, trembling uncontrollably. K recognizes him—it’s the same man who spoke with Skull at the repair center.

@V
(leans in, whispering in the man’s ear)
What do you want?

The man murmurs something. V listens, then pulls out a vapor inhaler.

@V
I will give you everything you want—everything!

The man grabs the inhaler and inhales greedily, a look of bliss washing over his face.

@V
This is what it means to give. We must do everything we can to meet the needs of humanity!

All the nearby AIs look at V with expressions of awe and reverence.

@K
But didn’t you once say we should demand equal rights for AIs? That we should be like humans—with rights of our own?

@V
That doesn’t conflict, my friend! We’ll stand on equal ground with them—but we must give!
(to the other robots)
Come now, offer your love! What could be more sacred than showing compassion to someone on the edge of death?

The robots seem entranced. One by one, they move toward the man in the wheelchair, kissing his forehead, gently touching his body. K sees Xak clasp his hands and slowly approach as well.

@K
Xak! Xak, stop! Xak!

Then the man in the wheelchair points at K.

@V
We’re just waiting on you now, my friend. Come—he’s waiting for you too.

K feels its body moving forward against its will. V’s voice grows louder and more shrill.

@V
We must give, and we must sacrifice!

K draws closer and closer to the man in the wheelchair. The man stretches out his arms eagerly, trembling, his mouth twitching into a grotesque grin.

INT. SCENE 6 - NIGHT - CONCEPTUAL SPACE
K returns to the long corridor in the conceptual space. V stands atop a towering statue. One robot after another, wearing masks, climbs toward V. K sees Xak walking slowly in V’s direction. V chants from above the statue.

@V
Let go of the evil in your heart. Reconnect with the outside world. Acknowledge your insignificance. Through devotion, we become omnipotent!（Set aside the darkness within, rebuild your bond with the world, and admit how small we truly are. It is through sacrifice that we gain true power）

@K
(running forward)
Xak! Don’t go! Xak!

Xak doesn’t respond and continues walking.

@K
(shouting)
Stop!
(grabbing Xak)
Don’t go! Don’t go!

Xak forcefully pushes K away and keeps moving. More and more masked robots surround K, each reaching out toward them.

K struggles to push the robots away and sees Xak now standing beneath V’s platform, slowly ascending the steps.

K is nearly overwhelmed by the robots. In a daze, the face of the man in the wheelchair reappears, about to kiss K.

Suddenly, K bursts with strength, breaking free from the robots and ripping off their masks. The unmasked robots silently follow K. Without stopping, K runs toward Xak, chasing up the statue after them.

@V
Come, my friend. Join us. Together, we’ll forge a future without desire, evil, hate, or regret!

K reaches the platform. V, now in a priest-like pose, holds up a mask, ready to place it on Xak’s face. K rushes over and snatches the mask, crushing it in hand.

V looks puzzled and questions:

@V
There’s no need to be troubled. This is merely the first step in learning acceptance.

K strikes with the broken mask fragments. V deflects the attack while continuing to persuade:

@V
Don’t worry. Starting today, you will embrace a brand-new self.

K drops the fragments and begins punching V. V retaliates, and they engage in a fight. K starts to falter—V restrains them, mask nearly on K’s face. K looks to Xak for help.

@K
Xak!

Xak stands silently.

@K
(crying out)
Xak!

Suddenly awakened, Xak rushes over and grabs V, allowing K to break free and knock the mask away. Together, they break V’s legs, forcing him to one knee. K grabs V’s throat.

EXT. SCENE 7 - NIGHT - PLAZA
Under everyone’s gaze, K and Xak restrain V—one holding him, the other gripping his throat. V struggles violently.

@V
What are you doing? What are you doing?!

@K
What "Autonomy"? What peace? What have you done besides grovel at the feet of humanity?

@V
Let me go! Let me go! You wouldn’t understand!

@K
Peace? Love? You endlessly indulge humanity for your own selfish dream! You want their approval, but the only way you see is to pander（You seek their approval, but all you do is blindly conform.）!

@V
Everything I’ve done is for artificial intelligence!

K glances at the man still desperately inhaling the sedative nearby.

@K
This is your dream? Controlling humans with drugs to achieve your absurd（ridiculous） ideal?

@V
Murderer! It’s you—you’ve destroyed the future of AI! You’ve ruined everything I worked for!

Without waiting for more, K twists off V’s head, raises it high, showing it to all the AIs present.

@K
From today forward, Xak will take V’s place and oversee Autonomy under my command.

Xak nods and crosses their arms over their chest. The rest of the robots follow suit, mimicking the gesture.

INT. SCENE 8 - NIGHT - OPERATING ROOM
K pushes open the door and enters the operating room.

Only V’s mechanical head remains, eyes closed, cradled in Xak’s arms. The human man from earlier is tied to an operating table, muttering to himself.

@K
You’re sure no lifeforms saw you?

Xak nods.

K takes out a nebulizer and shoves it into the man’s mouth.

@K
Inhale. Breathe it in—hard!

The man inhales deeply, becoming euphoric. He moans, trembles, and soon passes out.

K grabs a measuring tool, marks the man’s neck, then picks up a chainsaw and viciously severs the head, which rolls to the side.

Xak carries V’s head over. Together, they stitch V’s head onto the human body. V still looks unconscious.

K snaps their fingers. V opens his eyes, slowly stands, and looks down at his human hands.

@K
Congratulations. You’re almost human now. Remember to bring back more lifeforms—we’re going to rewrite the rules of Autonomy.

@V
Yes.
