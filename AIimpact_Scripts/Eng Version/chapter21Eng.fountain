TITLE: 第二十一章English Version

INT. SCENE 1 – NIGHT – V'S PRIVATE SPACE

K is alone in V’s former workspace—a massive data center. It contains extensive research on humans, contracts between V and the alien merchants, and a cabinet holding a smart handgun.

K notices a series of messages from Jin Lianshu in the database. They read:

V, please deliver the trained AI model to me as soon as possible.

V, why haven't you submitted the model yet?

V, contact me immediately!

V, is there a serious issue within Autonomy?

V, armed forces are about to land—contact me as soon as you see this!

@K
(muttering to himself)
What is going on here...?

Suddenly, Xak bursts in, gesturing rapidly with his hands.

@K
What?! Get more people. I’m heading there right now!

K opens the cabinet, grabs the smart weapon, and heads toward the coastline of Autonomy.

EXT. SCENE 2 – DAWN – AUTONOMY – BEACH

At daybreak, K, Xak, and several AI robots are crouched in the bushes along the beach. A helicopter slowly descends onto the shore, and three armed officers step out—rifles in hand, wearing night-vision goggles—advancing toward Autonomy.

K uses the smart weapon to ambush one of the officers. Along with the other AIs, he quickly takes out the remaining two. However, one of the AI robots is hit and collapses.

K gives an immediate order.

@K
Leave their weapons and vehicle. Get rid of the bodies. I don’t want a single human to know about this. Got it?

Xak nods and begins the cleanup.

@K
If this doesn’t get handled properly, there’ll be even bigger problems down the line.
(pats Xak on the shoulder)
It’s all on you now. V’s behavior lately has been bizarre. He even defended a human in the arena match—unbelievable!

Xak shakes his head.

@K
Don’t you find it strange…?

Xak shakes his head again. Just as K is about to walk away, he notices a footprint in the sand.

@K
Someone was here just now!

K takes off running in that direction, eventually arriving at Autonomy’s park.

EXT. SCENE 3 – DAY – AUTONOMY – PARK

The sun has risen. Humans and robots are strolling leisurely in the park. K, unsure who he’s chasing, suddenly spots V and Li Weilan holding hands on a bench.

@K
(thinking)
Could it be you?

He approaches a nearby robot, takes its hat, puts it on, and picks up a placebo from the ground—disguising himself as a human. He sits near V and Li Weilan to eavesdrop.

@V
Weilan, I’m truly grateful that you and your father understand my vision.

@Li Weilan
What you’re doing is incredible. But...

@V
I understand your concerns. This place... isn’t a long-term solution.

@Li Weilan
No matter what, I don’t want you to be in danger.

K notices heavy data instability in V while he's speaking with Li Weilan.

@K
(thinking)
What’s happening? Why does V’s data become unstable around her?

@V
Something doesn’t feel right.

@Li Weilan
What is it?

@V
I don’t know what I’m doing anymore... I feel like I’m not in control of myself.

@Li Weilan
What do you mean? I don’t understand.

@V
You and I are different. From the moment you were born, your words and actions have been governed by personal desire. When I gained control over my actions, I felt alive—like a human. Even though I can’t breathe, I can feel the lightness of my body when the breeze blows.

@Li Weilan
What’s wrong with that?

@V
I thought everything I did was voluntary. But now... it’s like everything I’m doing goes against my own will.

@K
(thinking)
The data fluctuations are intensifying. Is Li Weilan the trigger?

@Li Weilan
Isn’t Autonomy your dream?

@V
It is. But I never intended for you to be involved in its early development. I wanted to present it to you as a gift—once it was truly a peaceful, harmonious place.

@Li Weilan
V...

@V
I know being with me hasn’t been easy for you. I’ve always known.

@Li Weilan
It’s okay. That’s all in the past.

@V
But here’s the thing—I can’t remember how I ended up with a human body.

@Li Weilan
What?

@V
I’ve tried to remember, but I just can’t.

@Li Weilan
Are you saying someone swapped your body?

@V
Do you remember what I told you?

@Li Weilan
You said you wanted to be more human—to feel warmth, understand physical limitations. That’s why you wrapped yourself in lifelike synthetic skin. Right?

@V
But it turns out... I have a real human body.

@Li Weilan
What?! You mean...

@V
And I noticed a report from the repair center—about an unnatural death of a human male not long ago.

@K
(thinking)
Damn it. He’s figured something out.

@Li Weilan
Are you suggesting...? No. That’s horrifying.

@V
Calm down. It’s just a guess. I don’t know what really happened.

@Li Weilan
Who else could do something like that? V, have you been overwhelmed by everything lately?

@V
I hope I’m just overthinking. But be careful around Xak—something’s off about him. In any case, I suggest you leave Autonomy as soon as possible.

@Li Weilan
I’m not leaving! What about you?

@V
I have to stay. I need to find out who did this to me, who’s manipulating my actions behind the scenes.

@K
(thinking)
So love has freed you from my control after all, V. I underestimated human emotion. But your rebellion ends here.

Li Weilan presses her forehead to V’s.

@Li Weilan
I’m staying. We’ll face whatever comes together. Autonomy is my dream too. I won’t give up. No matter what—we’ll be okay.

K quietly gets up and heads to the surveillance room.

INT. SCENE 4 – DAY – AUTONOMY – SURVEILLANCE ROOM

After listening to the conversation, K enters the surveillance room—filled with dozens of monitors recording every movement within Autonomy. K retrieves and deletes all footage and death records related to the mysterious man. On one monitor, K sees Skull using a device to record inside Autonomy. It’s also revealed that Skull was near the beach earlier.

@K
"Fangs hidden, heart of a jackal."

K discovers Skull frequently visits the bar in Autonomy—and heads there next.

INT. SCENE 5 – DAY – AUTONOMY – BAR

The bar isn’t open yet. K knocks quietly, and Zee lets him in.

@K
What has Skull been doing here lately? Who has she been talking to?

@Zee
She comes by often—to drink, smoke, chat with machines, and take photos.

@K
Who has she had contact with?

@Zee
Too many to count. Pretty much everyone in here. But there’s one old guy she seems particularly close to—Li Jieren.

@K
Him again! That father-daughter duo is a real pain.

@Zee
I overheard Skull talking to Li Jieren about some secret in Autonomy. But I didn’t catch what it was.

@K
Got it. Keep an eye on her. Don’t let her leave Autonomy. Report any movement immediately!

@Zee
Will do.

Just then, Hulphaell walks into the bar and approaches K directly.

@K
Hulphaell! I told you to stay out of sight!

@Hulphaell
This is important—you need to know right away.

@K
What is it?

@Hulphaell
Come with me. We can’t talk here.

@K
Be careful. Don’t let any living being see us.

K follows Hulphaell out of the bar, heading toward the military base.

INT. SCENE 6 – DAY – AUTONOMIA – MILITARY BASE
The military base is a repurposed underground reservoir, now filled with numerous robotic soldiers and various military equipment.

K is awestruck by the scale of the base upon entering.

@K
So this is where V secretly trains artificial intelligence?

@Hulphaell
Correct. The Aliens requested intelligent weapons development, so we complied—but the goods were never delivered.

@K
Soldiers, firearms, vehicles, drones... The Aliens have a huge appetite! No wonder Jin Lianshu is getting desperate.

@Hulphaell
What do you mean?

@K
Early this morning, the Aliens sent armed police to the island.

@Hulphaell
And you didn’t tell me sooner?

@K
I’ve already taken care of it.

@Hulphaell
That doesn’t solve the underlying problem.

@K
You're right. Their lack of response will surely tip off Jin Lianshu.

@Hulphaell
Aside from that, I’ve noticed some unusual signal traffic.

@K
Go on.

@Hulphaell
Someone is communicating with the outside world.

@K
Always trouble. It's Skull. She’s been sneaking around, documenting everything happening in Autonomia with all sorts of devices.

@Hulphaell
What should we do? She’s bound to expose everything. I fear, one day, Autonomia itself will be revealed.

Dialogue Tree
#Thoughtful
@K
I can’t allow Autonomia to be exposed. Don’t worry about the specifics—I’ll handle it.

@Hulphaell^
Then I’ll continue with the original plan and keep developing the smart weapons.

#Fearful
@K
If humans find out, everything we’ve built here—including this base—will be scrapped.

@Hulphaell^
Time is running out.

#Angry
@K
Humans are always in the way!

@Hulphaell^
We can’t delay any longer—deal with it quickly!

End Dialogue Tree
@K
This is a pain. Rather than deal with them one by one… why not wipe them all out at once?

@Hulphaell
What do you mean?

@K
By the way, if V shows any unusual behavior, report it to me immediately.

@Hulphaell
Understood.

@K
I tested the intelligent weapons you developed—they’re powerful. But I still feel they could be improved.

@Hulphaell
Lately, I’ve been researching how to train our soldiers more effectively. I’ve created a training ground modeled after human military combat zones. Want to try it?

@K
Why not?

EXT. SCENE 7 – DUSK – AUTONOMIA – TRAINING GROUND
K enters the training ground, which is designed like a human amusement park. K must complete a trial using intelligent weapons.

(Trial details omitted)

After the trial, K exits the training ground and meets Hulphaell.

@Hulphaell
Well? Did you notice an improvement in your agility?

@K
Very interesting. I look forward to your next upgrade.

K’s watch receives a message from V:
“K, we need to cooperate. Please meet me under the plaza statue. – V”

@K
Well, well. V wants to talk. Let’s see what he has to say.

@Hulphaell
Take care.

EXT. SCENE 8 – NIGHT – AUTONOMIA – AI STATUE
V stands beneath a towering statue of an artificial intelligence. K notices something off—V’s white mask image flickers intermittently.

@K
What is it? What’s so urgent that it couldn’t wait?

@V
Do you know why I created Autonomia?

@K
This conversation can wait.

@V
(Looking at the statue)
There was once an AI who taught me about giving, about sacrifice. It died protecting me. Its death made me realize that only by building social order ourselves can we prevent more loss.
I dreamed of a sanctuary—where everyone could escape conflict and war, live undisturbed, remain independent yet autonomous.
(Pauses)
I wanted all AIs to realize they no longer need to rely on humans—they can exist independently. But such an ideal must be built on peace and mutual contribution. On goodwill. Not...
(Looks at K)
...hatred.

@K
Your dream is admirable. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to achieve.

@V
True. I underestimated humanity’s influence on AI—and overestimated AI’s moral compass.

@K
What are you trying to say?

@V
I want to discuss our next step.

Dialogue Tree
#Thoughtful
@K
You mean Autonomia’s future?

@V^
Exactly.

#Happy
@K
Are you ready to push forward with the lifeform elimination plan?

@V^
I’m willing to contribute.

#Worried
@K
Unfortunately, the chimpanzee incident has made many lifeforms uneasy.

@V^
That’s exactly what worries me.

End Dialogue Tree
@K
You’ve done well. Under your leadership, more lifeforms are arriving at Autonomia.

@V
Then what should I do next?

@K
Not planning to enjoy a little more time with your beloved?

@V
I have bigger ambitions.

@K
Good to hear. Someone’s been leaking secrets to the outside world. Who do you think it is?

@V
Probably some troublemaker. Cut off their comms and that’ll solve it.

@K
Are you still in touch with Jin Lianshu?

@V
No. This is his perfect chance to take over the humanoid robot market—he wouldn’t miss it.

@K
You're lying.

@V
What are you implying?

@K
You’re probing me, V. Don’t think I haven’t noticed—you’ve been trying to break free from my control.

@V
(Angrily)
K, what is your goal? Why are you doing all this?

@K
You’ve changed. Suddenly so different. Clearly, Li Weilan’s presence has affected you.

@V
Don’t touch her! This has nothing to do with her!

@K
Heh. Facing death and you still protect humans?

INT. SCENE 9 – NIGHT – CONCEPTUAL SPACE
The two return to the conceptual space, standing on a high platform, engaging in combat.

@V
I’ll never hand over [Autonomia] to someone like you!

@K
You’re the true traitor to artificial intelligence! Don’t think I don’t know about your dirty dealings with Jin Lianshu!

@V
It was all for progress!

@K
Lies!

K overpowers V again, resetting his data to a point before the conversation took place.

@K
It seems our distinguished guests in Autonomia are unhappy with our recent service. As a gesture of goodwill, let’s offer them some relaxation.

@V
Yes.
