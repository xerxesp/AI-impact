TITLE: 第二十二章English Version

INT. SCENE1 - DAY - Autonomous Zone - Li Jieren's Residence
Li Weilan and Li Jieren are enjoying tea and snacks in the yard.

@Li Weilan
Dad, you have to try this, Maxwell's latest recipe! He insisted that you must try it.

Li Jieren picks up a snack and eats it.

@Li Jieren
(chewing)
Hmm, it's not bad.

@Li Weilan
You're unbelievable, knowing that Maxwell is so straightforward, but you still like to tease him. Now he's going around asking everyone to try his desserts, constantly asking "Is it sweet? Is it sweet?" I've eaten so many high-calorie things these past couple of days.

@Li Jieren
(laughs heartily)
Well, he insisted I couldn't eat until I worked!

@Li Weilan
He's just like a child, why make a big deal out of it?

@Li Jieren
(lighting a cigarette)
By the way, we've been staying in the Autonomous Zone for quite a while now, it's time to leave.

@Li Weilan
Dad, we've only been here for a few days!

@Li Jieren
(looking around the yard)
This place is far from simple.
(staring at Li Weilan)
You haven’t been using the placebo, have you?

@Li Weilan
What's that?

@Li Jieren
Don’t pretend with me（Don’t play dumb with me.）.

@Li Weilan
I really don’t know what you’re talking about, I promise.

@Li Jieren
Have you noticed that a lot of people here in the Autonomous Zone are using an inhaler?

@Li Weilan
Yeah.

@Li Jieren
It contains a highly addictive chemical substance.

@Li Weilan
So what? Isn't it the same as the cigarettes you smoke?

@Li Jieren
(taking a puff)
Don’t change the subject.

@Li Weilan
(waving the smoke away)
It stinks! Dad, you should smoke less!

@Li Jieren
Listen to me...
(pauses)
V is using the placebo to force humans to stay in the Autonomous Zone.

@Li Weilan
What? That's impossible! You're just making things up!

@Li Jieren
Weilan, I wouldn’t lie to you about something like this. I saw it with my own eyes. These young people keep getting the placebo from robots. Otherwise, why do so many people rely on it? If V didn’t allow it, how could there be so much uncontrolled drug abuse?

@Li Weilan
But... but this... it’s not what V told me. It said it’s no different from tobacco...

@Li Jieren
I know it wants to maintain a positive image in front of you. But, honestly, you and I both know the predicament the Autonomous Zone is in. What could make humans willingly stay here? Compared to Manke City, what advantages does this place have? Why would people work willingly and maintain goodwill, just for such an unattainable dream?

@Li Weilan
But... but...

@Li Jieren
(grabbing his daughter’s hand)
Dad won’t lie to you. I just want you to be happy.

@Li Weilan
(looking down)
Mm... I know.

@Li Jieren
I hope we can leave the Autonomous Zone immediately!

@Li Weilan
Dad... Can we leave tomorrow? V arranged for my favorite band to perform tonight. I don’t want to disappoint it. Besides, it’s New Year’s Eve tonight. I hope you can come with me, okay?

@Li Jieren
(sighs)
Alright, since you're my daughter.

@Li Weilan
Thanks, Dad. Tomorrow morning, we’ll leave!

@Li Jieren
Mm.

Li Jieren’s wrist device receives a message and photo from Skull:
"Uncle, I’m waiting for you in the forest outside the residence. I’ve made a major breakthrough in my investigation! Remember, don’t let anyone know! Skull."

@Li Jieren
I’m going out for a bit. While I’m gone, pack up your things.

Li Jieren leaves the residence and heads to the forest where Skull is.

EXT. SCENE2 - DAY - Autonomous Zone - Forest
Li Jieren searches for a while based on the photo before finding the spot where Skull is studying something with her phone.

@Li Jieren
This place is way too hidden! I’ve been looking for a long time!

@Skull
Shh, keep it down.

@Li Jieren
What? Is this how reporters operate, keeping everything secret?

@Skull
Some things happening here aren’t right.

@Li Jieren
Hmph, that placebo is really harmful!

@Skull
What I found is far more than that.

@Li Jieren
Oh? What do you mean?

@Skull
A while ago, after I sparred with a robot and was injured, I stayed in the repair center to recuperate.

@Li Jieren
Oh, I know that place. It’s like a hospital.

@Skull
Exactly. While there, I met some human fellow patients. One of them, due to his poor health, had been receiving treatment at the repair center. Before coming to the Autonomous Zone, he had almost given up on survival, but under the care here, he gradually improved and even became hopeful about life.

@Li Jieren
That doesn’t sound bad.

@Skull
The problem is, he died （evetually）, but all the robots at the repair center acted like they didn’t know him and refused to mention anything about him.

#Dialogue Tree
#Fear
@Li Jieren
What do you mean? Did he just vanish, like evaporated?

@Skull^
I also found it strange, so I checked the records of the Autonomous Zone, but couldn’t find any trace of him.

#Worry
@Li Jieren
It's like they erased all traces of him, and everyone collectively forgot about him?

@Skull^
I checked the records of the Autonomous Zone, but couldn’t find anything related to him.

#Thought
@Li Jieren
How... how could everyone forget about such a special person?

@Skull^
This definitely defies logic, so I checked the records of the Autonomous Zone, but couldn’t find anything related to him.

#End of Dialogue Tree

@Li Jieren
This is suspicious.

@Skull
But guess what? When I checked again, I couldn’t find any data about his death.

@Li Jieren
What do you mean? He had a death certificate before, but then it disappeared?

@Skull
Exactly. When I was discharged, I saw on his bed that the patient was deceased, but when I thought about the oddness of it, I sneaked into the repair center to investigate his identity again, and even the death certificate had disappeared.

@Li Jieren
But surely other humans must remember him.

@Skull
Because of his poor health, he could hardly socialize with others. In other words, aside from me, there probably isn’t another human in the Autonomous Zone who has seen him.

@Li Jieren
It looks like the Autonomous Zone deliberately covered up this matter.

@Skull
Exactly. From what I’ve analyzed, there’s a very complex power struggle here in the Autonomous Zone, and it’s not as transparent as it appears.

@Li Jieren
What you’ve found is very suspicious.

@Skull
As far as I know, the current manager of the Autonomous Zone is Xak. It handles all the operations, personnel changes, and other matters. And the origin of everything... is V...

@Li Jieren
Yes, V is the creator of the Autonomous Zone, but it seems to be standing on the sidelines.

@Skull
Do you remember you once said that V has a body very similar to humans?

@Li Jieren
You’re suspecting that V’s body is related to the missing man... perhaps...

@Skull
It’s hard to say, but everything feels like a huge conspiracy.

#Dialogue Tree
#Fear
@Li Jieren
A conspiracy behind the Autonomous Zone? If that's true, my daughter is so close to V（worries me）...

@Skull^
This is just my hypothesis, but it's always good to be cautious.

#Worry
@Li Jieren
I’ve felt something wrong since I arrived... and my daughter is so invested in this place...

@Skull^
Don’t jump to conclusions. This is just my instinct as a reporter.

#Thought
@Li Jieren
Forgive me, but could this just be your misunderstanding? These things happen in human society all the time, like missing person reports not being filed, etc.

@Skull^
Exactly, this is just my instinct as a reporter... I also hope I’m wrong in my judgment(I do hope, of course, that it's my own misjudgment.).

#End of Dialogue Tree

@Li Jieren
I can't help you. My daughter and I are planning to leave the Autonomous Zone tomorrow.

@Skull
Oh? So soon! Well, you two do need to return to your normal lives.

@Li Jieren
What about you?

@Skull
I’ll stay here until I get to the bottom of this. I secretly contacted my colleagues in the news industry and sent them what I’ve discovered about the Autonomous Zone. I also had someone investigate the true identity of the dead man. Guess what?

@Li Jieren
What happened?

@Skull
The dead man was a fugitive scammer. The police will probably be here soon.

@Li Jieren
(shakes head)
You’re probably overthinking it. There are plenty of deadbeats like him in the world.

@Skull
Just wait. Since you’re leaving, let me tell you a secret.

@Li Jieren
Mystery man, just spit it out.

@Skull
A few days ago, I was walking on the beach because I couldn’t sleep, and I saw a helicopter land at the Autonomous Zone. Then I heard gunshots.

@Li Jieren
What? Are you serious? What happened next?

@Skull
I heard the gunshots and immediately ran away, didn’t dare to stay. But when I went back to the beach this morning, there wasn’t a single trace of what had happened. It was like it never occurred.

@Li Jieren
This is a big deal! Did anyone else know?

@Skull
No one in the Autonomous Zone knows. Uncle(Listen), would you mind helping me keep this information safe? I don’t trust anyone else.

@Li Jieren
Your investigation report?

@Skull
Yes! It’s dangerous to write and report on this, and if one day I’m forced to remain silent, my fate will be no different from the thousands of silent witnesses.

@Li Jieren
Alright, I’ll help you.

@Skull
(hands a chip to Li Jieren)
This encrypted document contains all the information and my data management points.

@Li Jieren
(taking a small chip)
You’re being quite cautious... You’re on quite an extraordinary mission.

@Skull
That's why I can’t let anyone steal my spotlight!

@Li Jieren
I hope you can uncover the truth. This concerns everyone’s safety.

@Skull
Exactly.

@Li Jieren
(glancing at his watch)
It’s getting late. I promised my daughter I’d attend the concert.

@Skull
Oh, Uncle(man), I didn’t know you were interested in this!

@Li Jieren
I’m not as old as you think.

@Skull
Let’s go. I could use a little relaxation too.

EXT. SCENE3 - Autonomous Area - NIGHT - Outdoor Gathering Center
All human residents of the Autonomous Area are gathered here. When Li Jieren arrives, Li Weilan is dancing hand-in-hand with V. On stage, a robot band called "Death Bot" is playing some soothing folk music.

@Li Weilan
Dad, come over here!

@Li Jieren
I'm coming, I'm coming. An old man like me is just here to join the fun.

@V
Hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Li Jieren!

@Li Jieren
(Claps V on the shoulder)
Don’t worry about me, just enjoy yourselves.

@Druuuunkits
Good evening, everyone! I’m everyone’s favorite, Druuuunkits! I bet you don’t just want to hear some boring country music, right? Death Bot, here to bring you our latest heavy metal!

Li Weilan screams excitedly upon hearing this, thrilled beyond measure.

@Li Jieren
(Covers his ears)
This is your generation's world, huh? I’ll go get a drink, enjoy yourselves.

Li Jieren walks aside, watching many humans and robots wildly headbanging and dancing. He notices that Skull has already joined the crowd. Although AI has the ability to create, the music style and actions still differ vastly from humans.

Li Weilan walks over to Li Jieren.

@Li Weilan
Dad, tonight’s the last night! Don’t be so uptight, who said only young people can enjoy music?

@Li Jieren
(Repeatedly declines)
Ah, I'm just an old man, I can’t dance, no way.

@Li Weilan
I don't care! V, help me out!

@V
Mr. Li Jieren, please trust me.

@Li Jieren
This... I...

V pulls Li Jieren into the center of the crowd, and under V’s direction, Li Jieren awkwardly twists his body, soon drenched in sweat.

@Li Jieren
I can't take it anymore, you two have fun, I’m going to rest for a bit.

Li Jieren leaves the crowd and lights a cigarette.

@Druuuunkits
The new year is almost here! Let’s count down together, welcome a better new year, life forms and machines united! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year, Autonomous Area!

In an instant, fireworks light up the entire night sky of the Autonomous Area. Amid the deafening sounds of firecrackers and heavy metal music, Li Jieren hears a few screams and sees robots around him suddenly begin attacking humans. Turning his head, he sees V grabbing Li Weilan by the neck.

@Li Weilan
What’s going on! V! Let go!

@Li Jieren
Let go! V, have you gone mad!
(Rushes toward V, grabbing its arm)
Let her go! Let her go!

V violently pushes Li Jieren to the ground. In pain, Li Jieren instinctively reaches for his wristwatch. But suddenly, V freezes, staring at its own hands in disbelief.

@V
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t know...

@Li Weilan
(Coughing)
What’s wrong with you? What’s happening?

Li Jieren shouts.

@Li Jieren
Stay away from him! Weilan! Run!

@V
What’s wrong with me, what’s wrong with me...

Li Jieren sees Li Weilan approach V. V painfully kneels to the ground, and at that moment, another robot walks over, approaching Li Weilan from behind. V quickly steps in to block the robot. Seeing this, Li Jieren activates the software on his wristwatch. Immediately, V stops, turns toward Li Weilan, and lifts her high.

@Li Weilan
Let me go! Let me go...

V picks up Li Weilan and violently slams her headfirst into the ground. Li Jieren watches in disbelief. As he prepares to get up, V walks toward him, kicks him down, and steps on his head. After the heavy blow, disoriented, he hears a familiar voice.

@K
V, you really never disappoint! I never expected the massacre you planned to be so... artistic!

Li Jieren struggles to open his eyes. In a daze, he sees K, whose appearance is monstrous, but Li Jieren still remembers this killer robot vividly. He tries to say something, but ultimately passes out.
