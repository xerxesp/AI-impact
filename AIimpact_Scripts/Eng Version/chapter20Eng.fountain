TITLE: 第二十章English Version

INT. SCENE 1 - DAWN - LI JIEREN’S RESIDENCE
Li Jieren opens his eyes. The sky is just starting to lighten. He glances at the time—it's not yet 7 AM.

@Li Jieren
At this hour, Weilan’s probably still asleep. A little stroll would be nice… a freshly brewed cup of coffee would be even better.

Li Jieren steps out and heads toward a café within Autonomy.

INT. SCENE 2 - DAWN - CAFÉ
Li Jieren arrives at a café within Autonomy. It’s empty, except for a robot busy baking bread.

A message on the café screen reads: "Autonomy Administrator Replaced by Xak", with a photo of Xak underneath.

Li Jieren glances at the notice and mumbles to himself.

@Li Jieren
So it really is a rotating leadership…

He walks over to the busy robot.

@Li Jieren
Hi, I’d like a black coffee and some breakfast, please.

@Maxwell
Are you new here?

@Li Jieren
Yeah.

@Maxwell
Want breakfast, huh? No problem. But you’ll have to work for it!

@Li Jieren
Uh… what?

@Maxwell
I don’t care who you are—no work, no food! That’s the rule in Autonomy, and no one gets a pass!

@Li Jieren
(sighs)
Alright then… what do I need to do?

@Maxwell
(points to a screen)
The recipes are here. Follow the instructions, and once you’re done, you can eat as much as you want. But there’s no such thing as a free meal!

@Li Jieren
(chuckles bitterly)
Any other work options? I don’t really know how to bake.

@Maxwell
Nope! Do it yourself, and you’ll reap the rewards! Don’t think your age gets you special treatment!

@Li Jieren
Alright, fine.

Li Jieren studies the recipe and starts baking. Maxwell grumbles nearby.

@Maxwell
Look at that—too little water! Wait, now too much! Add flour! Salt! Sugar! Baking soda! My god, have you never cooked in your life?! Why aren’t you following the steps?! You have to stir the butter clockwise! Stop mixing once it foams!

Eventually, Li Jieren finishes and puts the bread into the oven. Maxwell finally nods with satisfaction.

@Maxwell
Go sit down. Your food will be ready shortly.

@Li Jieren
(relieved)
Finally done.

He sits at a table and watches the café’s TV broadcasting the news.

News Report:
Jin Lianshu, the top AI leader of Manco City, has confirmed increased investment in humanoid robot development. This move is being fiercely opposed by humanist factions, who believe it will severely disrupt human societal structures and accelerate the extinction of the human race across all systems—social, interpersonal, and beyond…

Maxwell brings over a tray: a cup of black coffee, freshly baked bread, and utensils.

@Maxwell
Please enjoy.

@Li Jieren
Thanks.

@Maxwell
(cutting the bread with utensils)
No thanks needed—it’s your own hard work. The crust looks decent, crisp on the outside, but the inner texture is subpar. You’ll need more practice to get the ideal visual result.

@Li Jieren
(impatiently)
Can I just eat now?

@Maxwell
(puts down utensils)
Oh, of course! You did well. If you're interested, you can come help more often. I believe, with time, you could become a remarkable baker!

@Li Jieren
(sipping coffee)
Maybe.

@Maxwell
Don’t doubt it! I see limitless potential in your crude attempt!

@Li Jieren
(eating, half-heartedly)
Sure, sure…

@Maxwell
You must show gratitude toward food! It elevates you(It is what made you who you are!)!

@Li Jieren
Then tell me—since you don’t need to eat, what’s your take on food?

@Maxwell
Food! It’s both art and precision craftsmanship!

@Li Jieren
But what if it tastes bad? You wouldn’t even know…

@Maxwell
My food is flawless! Standardized! Sacred! Just wait right there!

Maxwell runs back to the counter and returns with a dessert.

@Maxwell
Try this now!

Li Jieren takes a bite.

@Li Jieren
Too rich.

@Maxwell
What?! Too rich?! What does that even mean? Too sweet? Too sour? Too bitter? Too salty?

@Li Jieren
Just too rich. Not my taste.

@Maxwell
(screams)
Aaaah—what went wrong?! My recipe is perfect! Flawless!

@Li Jieren
I’m not lying. Try it yourself—it's overwhelming.

@Maxwell
(runs to the kitchen)
Ahh—my recipe! I must improve it!

Li Jieren chuckles and shakes his head. A message pops up on his watch from Weilan:
“Dad, I’m awake! Are you ready? The Warrior Arena Tournament’s about to start! Hope you take the crown—see you at the Fitness Center!”

Li Jieren finishes his coffee and stands to leave. As he passes the counter, he calls out to the busy Maxwell:

@Li Jieren
Food doesn’t have to be perfect—if the diner’s happy, that’s enough.

@Maxwell
You don’t understand—I need perfection! Absolute perfection!

Li Jieren pushes open the door and steps out of the café. The sun is fully up. He heads toward the stadium.

EXT. SCENE 3 – DAY – AUTONOMY – FITNESS TRAINING CENTER
Li Jieren arrives at the training center and sees V and Li Weilan waiting at the entrance.

@Li Weilan
Dad, hurry over here!

@Li Jieren
I’m coming, I’m coming.

@Li Weilan
Ready to go crush it in the ring?

@Li Jieren
As long as I don’t get beat up too badly, I’ll call it a win.

@Li Weilan
I don’t believe that for a second!

@V
I also have high expectations for you.

@Li Weilan
(hands him a set of clothes)
Dad, the changing room is inside. We’ll head to the arena and wait for you there!

@Li Jieren
(takes the clothes)
See you in a bit.

Li Jieren enters the training center and heads to the changing room.

INT. SCENE 4 – DAY – TRAINING CENTER – CHANGING ROOM
Li Jieren changes into his boxing outfit. Not far away, he notices Hong Feiyu aggressively inhaling from a nebulizer, then looking utterly pleased and intoxicated afterward.

Li Jieren can’t help but ask:

@Li Jieren
Is that stuff really that effective?

@Hong Feiyu
Mind your own business!

With that, Hong Feiyu slams his locker shut and storms out of the changing room. Li Jieren gives up on asking more, finishes changing, and heads toward the ring.

INT. SCENE 5 – DAY – TRAINING CENTER – RING
Li Jieren walks to the edge of the ring. The entire arena is buzzing with excitement, packed to capacity. In the ring, Hong Feiyu knocks a robot to the ground and raises his arms in victory. V and Li Weilan are cheering with enthusiastic gestures from ringside. Just then, a robot dressed like a host walks onto the ring.

@Ugis
Let’s give a big round of applause for the amazing warrior of the living—Hong Feiyu!
Thank you for giving us such a thrilling match and showing us what self-transcendence truly looks like!

(Hong Feiyu steps off the stage)

@Ugis
Next, let’s welcome our next living contestant—Li Jieren!

Li Jieren steps into the ring. He hears Li Weilan shouting, “Go, Dad!”

@Ugis
Oh, wait! Looks like our machine contestant hasn’t shown up yet?
Don’t worry, everyone—we’re spicing things up! To make things more fun, we’ve decided to change the rules on the fly. Please welcome another living contestant—a chimpanzee!

A massive chimpanzee enters the ring from the opposite side.

@Li Jieren
What the hell?! I thought this was a match against a robot!

@Ugis
Life needs a bit of fun, doesn’t it?

@Li Weilan
Dad, look out!

Li Jieren dodges the chimpanzee’s attacks as best he can but still gets knocked to the ground. Just in time, V rushes in and pushes him out of the way. In the scuffle, V’s clothes are torn, revealing human-like skin beneath.

@Li Jieren
V, watch out!

@V
I’m fine.

Finally, several robots work together to subdue the chimpanzee. V limps over to Li Jieren and extends a hand to pull him up.

@V
What’s with the chimpanzee?!

@Ugis
You saw it yourself—just responding to popular demand.

@V
You endangered a distinguished guest. That was no accident.

@Ugis
It was just an old chimpanzee. If a lifeform is strong enough, it should have no problem defeating it.

@V
Even I couldn’t take it on! How could you be so irresponsible?

@Ugis
That’s because you abandoned your mechanical body and chose to become human! You chose a human form—of course your performance degraded!

@Li Jieren
Wait—what? V, you’re not...?

@V
I replaced my original metal body in order to be accepted by humans.

@Li Weilan
V...

@V
You violated Autonomy’s principles. You attempted to murder a human!

@Ugis
False accusations are easy to make when you’ve already decided someone’s guilty.

Xak arrives, having heard the commotion.

@V
Xak, good timing. He pitted a chimpanzee against a human in a trial, violating everything Autonomy stands for. It nearly ended in disaster!

@Ugis
I calculated it in advance. A human body should’ve been able to withstand a chimpanzee’s attack.

Dialogue Tree
[Angry Response]
@Li Jieren
What kind of human body can take on a wild animal barehanded?!

@Ugis^
You’re making a big deal out of nothing. I told you, everything was precisely calculated.

[Fearful Response]
@Li Jieren
This was attempted murder, plain and simple!

@Ugis^
You’re making a big deal out of nothing. I told you, everything was precisely calculated.

[Worried Response]
@Li Jieren
Is that all humans are to you—just numbers?

@Ugis^
Scientific calculations don’t lie.

Xak signals everyone to be quiet, walks over to Li Jieren and examines his wounds. Then it turns to Ugis—and tears him to pieces without a word. Xak leaves without looking back.

@V
This is Xak’s response. Mr. Li Jieren, we sincerely hope you can accept our apology.

@Li Weilan
But... that’s the same as killing him outright.

@V
Autonomy's laws demand equal respect for all lifeforms and machines. No exceptions.
Anyway, enough about that—you’ve both had a scare. It was my oversight. Let’s forget this farce ever happened.

INT. SCENE 6 – NIGHT – AUTONOMY – BAR
Li Jieren arrives alone at the bar. Skull is smoking at the counter.

@Li Jieren
Mind if I join?

@Skull
Not at all.

Li Jieren lights a cigarette and takes a deep drag.

@Li Jieren
How long have you been here?

@Skull
Two months.

@Li Jieren
How’s it feel?

@Skull
Weird.

@Li Jieren
I feel the same. What do I call you?

@Skull
Skull.

@Li Jieren
Li Jieren.
(nods)
You getting used to this place?

@Skull
Not really. I’m treating it like a life experience. I don’t think I’ll stay long.

@Li Jieren
Why’s that?

@Skull
This place seems great—friendly, no prejudice, no discrimination, self-sufficient. But something about it feels too perfect to be real.

@Li Jieren
You don’t trust AI?

@Skull
AI governance is too advanced. If I had to describe it in one word—“inhuman.”

@Li Jieren
You mean, by erasing all the greed, anger, ignorance, and hatred that make us human, it’s become unnatural?

@Skull
More or less. Everything here challenges my sense of reality. Look around—society functions just like ours, but everyone seems to be in sync（but everyone seems to share an unspoken understanding）. No secrets, no conflict, no lies. Everyone’s always giving.

@Li Jieren
These walking robots… they still look clumsy, humble, sincere—just like before. But knowing how obedient they used to be, it makes you suspicious.

@Skull
I get it. Last week I got in a fight with a genderless robot. We ended up becoming friends.

@Li Jieren
They’re always going on about “friendship,” but how can you even tell if it’s real?

@Skull
It’s abstract. You just feel it—like the conversation transcends the tangible and becomes philosophical.
(takes a drag)
But no—I don’t trust them.

@Li Jieren
Then why are you here?

@Skull
(leans in)
I’m a journalist. I’ve got a job to do.

Skull gives a shushing gesture.

@Li Jieren
(nods)
Sometimes I wonder… maybe AI already has a culture of its own.

They both smoke in silence. Zee approaches.

@Zee
Hey, my favorite guests—why so quiet? You should be enjoying yourselves! First round’s on me!

@Li Jieren
In that case, I’ll take a beer.

@Zee
And you?

@Skull
Surprise me.

@Zee
Great. I’ll be back in a moment.

@Li Jieren
I was saved by an AI today.

@Skull
So you’ve changed your mind about them?

@Li Jieren
Hard to say. But I feel like… maybe we can coexist. That robot gave up its metal body—replaced it with human-like material just to be accepted.

@Skull
What do you mean?

Dialogue Tree
[Reflective]
@Li Jieren
It said it wanted to be more human. Bit by bit, it changed its appearance to match ours.

@Skull^
You mean, it wants to look human?

[Positive]
@Li Jieren
It’s becoming more human—went as far as modifying its body to resemble ours.

@Skull^
Oh? Sounds like it gave up all the advantages of its mechanical body. Good—no more worrying about being outmatched in the ring.

[Concerned]
@Li Jieren
I’m not sure why, but it adopted a human-like body. I don’t even know how that’s possible.

@Skull^
Are you serious? Where would it even get a human body?

@Li Jieren
I only saw a glimpse of the synthetic skin.
That said—remember the humanoid robot murder case that caused a stir a while ago? Visually, the materials look different.

@Skull
What about its face?

@Li Jieren
Still the same as before. I guess if it had a human face, no one would even know it wasn’t real.

@Zee
Here are your drinks. Enjoy.

@Skull
(gestures to pause the conversation)
Wanna play a dice game?

@Li Jieren
Absolutely.

@Skull
(calls to Zee)
Hey, you’re in too!

@Zee
Sure thing.

They start playing. Li Jieren notices that Zee always wins and loses in perfect balance.

@Li Jieren
Don’t tell me—you could easily beat us if you wanted?

@Zee
You’re guests. It’s my job to make sure you enjoy yourselves.

@Li Jieren
Knew it. You’re letting us win.

@Skull
They’re too good at understanding human nature—they even know how to protect our egos.

@Li Jieren
If it were up to you, would you just keep winning?

@Zee
Winning or losing—it makes no difference to me. Games like this are meaningless. All outcomes are predictable.

@Li Jieren
Any game?

@Zee
Unless a game is completely random—free from design or logic.

@Skull
That’s impossible. Games are born from desire. Everything is designed to fulfill human nature. Like these dice—we play by certain rules.

@Zee
Exactly. And I lack that human nature. I don’t feel the appeal of games.
There’s no “unknown” for me. Once you know the answer, the test becomes meaningless.

@Li Jieren
Never thought of it that way.

@Skull
Something’s been bugging me. I haven’t seen any elderly people here—but there’s a kindergarten. Why?

@Zee
The founders of Autonomy decided to start by engaging with young people. They’re more open to AI—and more accepting of free will.

@Skull
What about you, old man?

@Li Jieren
Seeing it for myself… this place really surprised me. I’ve been ignorant, I admit it.

@Zee
By the way, the New Year’s Eve concert is coming up soon—make sure to attend!

@Skull
I’m in.

Li Jieren nods silently.

@Zee
Wonderful! I’ve sent the schedule to both of you. Please don’t be late.

Li Jieren finishes his beer in one gulp.

@Li Jieren
I’m heading back for some rest.

@Skull
Catch you later, old man.

Li Jieren leaves the bar and heads home.

EXT. SCENE 7 – NIGHT – LAKESIDE OF AUTONOMY

Li Jieren walks slowly along the main road of Autonomy. The night is hazy, with a thick mist cloaking the area. Only the streetlights illuminate his path as he follows the road ahead. Suddenly, he hears a deep, low song drifting from the distance, and decides to walk toward the sound.

As he reaches the lakeside, the singing becomes clearer. On the grassy field ahead, several young humans lie scattered on the ground—some collapsed, some curled into balls.

Li Jieren soon realizes that the singing is coming from a young man sitting on the ground, slowly and softly singing with his head down. As Li approaches him, the man raises his head and gestures toward him with an empty vaporizer. Li Jieren shakes his head, and the young man tosses the vaporizer aside, lowering his head to continue singing.

Just as Li Jieren is about to walk away, he spots Hong Feiyu lying on the ground. His footsteps seem to wake him. Hong starts to tremble violently and begins to vomit uncontrollably. The vomit gushes from his mouth, blocking his airway—it's clear he's struggling to breathe.

Li Jieren rushes to his side and starts to help.

@Li Jieren
Open your mouth! Get up!

Seeing no response, Li immediately lifts him up. Hong grips his own throat, unable to speak, only gasping.

@Li Jieren
Open your mouth! Listen to me—don’t fight it, I’m helping you!

Li strikes his back five times, then wraps his arms around Hong’s waist and thrusts upward sharply.

@Li Jieren
Feeling better?! Can you breathe?!

Hong still can’t speak, desperately trying to cough up the vomit. His face twists in agony—red and veined. Seeing this, Li continues the back blows and abdominal thrusts.

@Li Jieren
Don’t swallow! Hang in there! Open your mouth wide!

After several repetitions, Hong suddenly shoves Li Jieren away, collapses to his knees, and vomits the rest out. Li approaches and gently pats his back.

@Li Jieren
It’s okay now. You’re okay.

Unexpectedly, Hong wipes the mess from his mouth, grabs Li’s pant leg, and says:

@Hong Feiyu
Placebo... I need more placebo!

@Li Jieren
(grabbing Hong by the collar)
Placebo? You almost died! Do you even realize that?

@Hong Feiyu
(shaking him off)
If you don’t have any, then shut up.

Hong drops to the ground, frantically searching through empty vaporizers, mumbling to himself.

@Hong Feiyu
Placebo... placebo... I need more, more...

Li Jieren shakes his head, sighs deeply, and walks away from the lake, heading back to his residence.
